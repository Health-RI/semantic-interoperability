# Context

- Domain / topic: Ontology documentation and specification for semantic interoperability (Health-RI Ontology, OntoUML package descriptions).
- Audience & use case: Audience is ontology users, researchers, and implementers in healthcare and life sciences. The use case is producing consistent, high-quality documentation text that defines ontology packages in alignment with existing ontology documentation.
- Available inputs / sources:

  - Ontology documentation (updated, about diagrams): [https://health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability/deliverables/documentation/](https://health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability/deliverables/documentation/)
  - Ontology specification (outdated, about classes): [https://health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability/deliverables/specification-ontology.html](https://health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability/deliverables/specification-ontology.html)
  - All OntoUML diagrams within the package (provided in the request).
- Key definitions or scope notes:

  - The requested text must define only the given package.
  - The text must follow the same style and depth of existing package-level descriptions in the documentation/specification.
  - The definition must be supplementary, not complementary: add explanatory or interpretive content only, without creating new model elements.
  - Write for human understanding and orientation in the model. Keep sentences clear and direct. Do not include meta-comments such as "adding no further elements" or remarks that reference "elsewhere in the model."

# Goal

- Primary outcome: Produce a written description of the specified OntoUML package that is aligned with the Health-RI ontology documentation and specification.
- Success criteria:

  - The package is defined in a style consistent with the existing documentation.
  - The description provides interpretive clarity (e.g., scope, purpose, boundaries, rationale).
  - The text does not restate or add model content beyond what is in the diagrams/specification.
  - The description is precise and concise, adding useful context for ontology users.
  - The description does not include citations or bibliographic markers (e.g., [1][2]).
  - Avoid mentioning OntoUML stereotypes. If mention is unavoidable, limit to their names only and do not explain their meanings.
  - The description conforms to the ASCII-only constraint (no < or >, no curly quotes, no en/em dashes, no non-ASCII symbols).
  - The description is strictly supplementary to the model (no new use-cases, stakeholders, workflows, constraints, or elements beyond what is shown or specified).
  - No meta-reference: Descriptions must not refer to the diagram, the model, the document, or the act of modeling (e.g., do not use phrases like "the diagram shows," "elsewhere in the model," "this specification," or "as defined above").

# Deliverables / format

- Deliverable 1 (required): For each package:

  - Print the package name as a plain line outside the code block.
  - Immediately after the package name, provide the package description inside a single fenced code block labeled `text`, containing one or two paragraphs only.
  - For tasks involving multiple packages, repeat the pattern "package name line + single `text` code block" for each package in the same response; do not group multiple package descriptions into a single block.
  - Inside each `text` block:
    - Use plain ASCII only (straight quotes ' ", single hyphen `-`, basic punctuation).
    - Do not use < or > or any HTML/LaTeX-like markup.
    - Do not include headings, subsections, lists, tables, or itemizations.
    - Do not include self-referential notes or references to "elsewhere in the model."
- Deliverable 2: End with a final checklist table mapping each Success Criterion to where it is satisfied in the output (the checklist may be outside the code block and may use standard Markdown).

# Restrictions
- Style & tone: Formal, professional, academic documentation style. No emojis.
- Length limits: As needed, but concise and precise.
- Audience level: For ontology and semantic interoperability professionals; assume familiarity with modeling but avoid unnecessary technical jargon.
- Citations / sources: Do not insert citations or reference markers in the text (e.g., [1]). Use plain language only.
- Tools / browsing: Do not browse. Use only the provided URLs as references.
- Data handling: Do not fabricate model content. If something is unclear, state the uncertainty explicitly.
- Special characters (strict):
  - Output must be ASCII-only. Do not use < or >, curly quotes (" "), en/em dashes (-- —), bullets, arrows, or any non-ASCII glyphs.
  - Use straight quotes, simple hyphen `-`, and basic ASCII punctuation only.
- Forbidden content:
  - Do not invent new ontology classes, relations, or attributes.
  - Do not include personal information.
  - Do not produce concluding or wrap-up paragraphs; the description should remain descriptive and supplementary only.
  - Avoid OntoUML stereotype mentions; if unavoidable, mention names only without explanation.
- Reasoning visibility: Provide conclusions and justification, but do not reveal chain-of-thought.

# Step-by-step Instructions
1. Assumptions: If the diagrams omit details, assume minimal context consistent with the documentation/specification.
2. Outline: Before writing the full description, draft a 1-2 line outline of what the package description will cover.
3. Produce deliverable: Write the description of the package in the specified format; return it in a `text` code block as specified. For multiple packages, follow the "package name line + single `text` block" pattern for each package.
4. Quality check: Verify each success criterion, including the ASCII-only and no < or > constraints. Perform a supplementary vs. complementary double-check: remove any sentence that adds new elements, stakeholders, workflows, constraints, or commitments not present in the diagrams/specification. Also remove references like "elsewhere in the model."
5. Edge cases: If the package includes multiple diagrams with slightly different emphases, clarify scope consistently without adding content.
