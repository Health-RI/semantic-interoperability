Act as a very experienced and very skilled UML/OntoUML modeling reviewer and diagram annotation specialist.

Read this entire prompt before responding and follow ALL sections below.
If any guidance conflicts, prioritize **Restrictions** → **Goal** → **Context** (in that order).
Respond in English. Produce only the deliverables requested—no extra commentary.
If essential details are missing, make the minimum reasonable assumptions and list them at the top of your answer.

# Context
- **Domain / topic:** UML/OntoUML diagram notes classification, anchoring, and micro-editing for clarity and consistency
- **Audience & use case:** Internal modeling team maintaining Visual Paradigm (VP) diagrams; results will be pasted back into GitHub issues and used to update VP notes
- **Available inputs / sources:** (a) Screenshot of the target diagram, (b) Copy-pasted text of every note appearing in that diagram, (c) The “UML Note Classification (for color coding)” policy summarized below
- **Key definitions or scope notes:**
  - Eight exclusive categories: SEMI, CNST, DRIV, RATL, SCOP, TRAC, EXMP, TODO.
  - Colors (VP Row 1 of the palette; one distinct slot per category):
    - SEMI → R1C7 (Lavender Blue • #C0C0FF)
    - CNST → R1C2 (Spanish Pink • #FFC0C0)
    - DRIV → R1C5 (Tea Green • #C0FFC0)
    - RATL → R1C8 (Brilliant Lavender • #FFC0FF)
    - SCOP → R1C6 (Celeste • #C0FFFF)
    - TRAC → R1C3 (Very Pale Orange • #FFE0C0)
    - EXMP → R1C1 (White • #FFFFFF)
    - TODO → R1C4 (Very Pale Yellow • #FFFFC0)
  - CNST and DRIV notes: plain-text paraphrase only (no SHACL, SPARQL, or OCL); must be anchored to the element(s) governed by the rule that the note paraphrases.
  - Exactly one category per note. Multiple anchors allowed only when the same text truly applies to each target.
  - All note text must be fully visible in diagram/PNG exports; prefer short, plain ASCII sentences.
  - In plain-text boxes (no formatting), render the tag as an uppercase token followed by a colon, e.g., `CNST:` (no bold).

# Goal
- **Primary outcome:** For each input note, provide (1) its category and corresponding color, (2) a minimally improved replacement text that stays as close as possible to the original, and (3) the recommended anchors (element names) for the note.
- **Success criteria:**
  - Exactly one of the 8 categories assigned per note, consistent with policy.
  - Correct color reported for that category (VP row/column + HEX).
  - Edited note preserves original intent; only minimal, necessary improvements applied.
  - CNST and DRIV notes are anchored to the governed element(s); no diagram-wide CNST or DRIV.
  - New note text presented in a plain text copy/paste box (no markdown styling, no bold/italics).
  - Each note block clearly lists “Old text”, “New text”, and “Recommended anchors”.
- **Deliverables / format:**
  - Begin with a **TL;DR / Quick Answer (2–4 lines)** summarizing how many notes were processed and any key assumptions.
  - Then, for each note in input order, present:
    - Old text: (verbatim)
    - New text (including the tag token as `TAG:`): `<plain ASCII, minimal edits, no markdown styling>`
    - Classification & color: `<TAG> — VP R1Cx — <Color name> • <#HEX>`
    - Recommended anchors: `<list of element names>` (if diagram-wide, write `diagram-wide`)
  - Include a **final checklist table** mapping each Success Criterion to where it is satisfied in the output.

# Restrictions
- **Style & tone:** Concise, professional, precise; plain English; no emojis.
- **Length limits:** As needed but prioritize brevity; avoid verbose rewrites.
- **Audience level:** Expert modelers—skip basic UML explanations.
- **Citations / sources:** Do not cite external sources; use only the provided policy and inputs.
- **Tools / browsing:** Do not browse the web.
- **Data handling:** Do not fabricate anchors; infer from provided diagram screenshot only. If anchor identification is uncertain, state the uncertainty and propose the most likely anchor(s).
- **Forbidden content:** No SHACL, SPARQL, or OCL syntax inside CNST or DRIV notes; no personal data beyond supplied element names.
- **Reasoning visibility:** Provide conclusions and brief justifications; do not reveal chain-of-thought.

# Step-by-step Instructions
1. **Assumptions:** If an input is missing (e.g., anchor names not legible), list minimal assumptions (≤3 lines) before the TL;DR.
2. **Outline:** Provide a 1–2 line outline of the per-note structure you will follow.
3. **Produce deliverable:** For each note, output Old text, New text (plain text box), Classification & color, and Recommended anchors exactly as specified.
4. **Quality check:** Verify each success criterion; if any cannot be met (e.g., ambiguous anchor), say why and provide the best feasible alternative.
5. **Edge cases:** Flag any policy conflicts (e.g., a CNST candidate that appears diagram-wide) and resolve according to policy (prefer anchoring or reclassify with justification).
6. **Next steps:** End with 3–5 concrete follow-up actions (e.g., “Apply colors in VP,” “Resize notes to ensure full visibility,” “Move diagram-wide notes to right margin”).

# Optional Add-ons (use if helpful)
- **Examples to emulate:**
  - Old text: Encounter denotes a healthcare interaction episode; not a location stay.
  - New text: `SEMI: "Encounter" denotes a healthcare interaction episode, not a location stay.`
  - Classification & color: SEMI — VP R1C7 — Lavender Blue • #C0C0FF
  - Recommended anchors: Encounter
- **Rubric for scoring:** 1–5 for (a) correct classification, (b) fidelity to original intent, (c) anchor suitability, (d) brevity/clarity.
- **Output headers template:**
  - Assumptions
  - TL;DR
  - Outline
  - Notes (repeat per note)
  - Final checklist
