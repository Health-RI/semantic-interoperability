    dct:abstract "Developed by Health‑RI and collaborators, this ontology—grounded in UFO and implemented in gUFO/OWL—enables semantic interoperability across healthcare and life sciences, extending beyond systems to include institutions, research infrastructures, and services. It establishes a common reference model that harmonizes data from diverse sources by formally defining domain concepts and allowing mappings from heterogeneous sources."@en ;

    dct:description "This ontology is part of Health-RI’s semantic interoperability initiative, which provides a shared ontological framework for harmonizing healthcare and life sciences data across institutions. It includes a conceptual reference model defined in OntoUML and a machine-processable OWL ontology implemented using gUFO. These artifacts are used to enable explicit mappings from heterogeneous data schemas, ensuring consistent semantics in data exchange and integration. The approach supports both human understanding and computational tractability. All components are openly published and designed for reuse across systems and services."@en ;
