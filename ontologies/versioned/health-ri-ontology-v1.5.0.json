The model follows the ontological notion of **<<mode>>**, representing intrinsic properties of a *Person*. However, while these modes always depend on the bearer (they are properties of them), their determination can be either intrinsic—depending only on the person’s own features—or extrinsic—requiring assessment or assignment by external agents.\n\nThis distinction is crucial to properly model the social, legal, and biological complexity of sex and gender in human contexts.",

        "description" : "The Sex package represents biological sex of persons along three axes: karyotypic sex, phenotypic sex, and sex at birth. It classifies persons by biological sex (male, female, indeterminate) using counts of sexual dimorphic characteristics and distinguishes karyotypic male and female, including regular and variant sex-chromosome composition. Phenotypic sex is treated as an observable condition of a person that can be classified as male, female, or ambiguous with reference to visual sex characteristics. Sex at birth is addressed as a registration category that distinguishes persons with assigned or unassigned sex at birth and specifies the categories male, female, or indeterminate.\n\nThe package separates characterization, assessment, and registration. Phenotypic sex may be established by one or more assessments involving a healthcare professional. Sex at birth is represented as an assignment recorded on a birth notification and may be governed by birth-related legislation rules. Karyotypic sex provides a chromosome-based characterization without prescribing decision rules. This structure keeps the dimensions of sex explicit, identifies the agents and artifacts involved in assessments and assignments, and supports consistent application of categories to persons.",

    "description" : "The diagram models Sex at Birth as an extrinsic mode that is determined through a process of formal assignment at the time of birth registration. While such assignments often rely on the newborn’s phenotypical features, they are not merely descriptive but the outcome of a social and administrative act recorded in official documents.\n\nThe process is represented by the relator Sex at Birth Assignment, which mediates between the Sex at Birth Assigner (a role typically played by a healthcare professional) and the Person with Assigned Sex at Birth. This mediation links the professional responsible for the classification to the person whose sex is being recorded. Persons may therefore appear either as Persons with Assigned Sex at Birth—further specified as male, female, or indeterminate—or as Persons with Unassigned Sex at Birth if no assignment has yet taken place.\n\nThe assignment is also tied to a Birth Notification, which documents the registration act. A constraint clarifies that a person cannot register their own birth notification, ensuring that the assignment is always performed by another agent. Furthermore, the model acknowledges the influence of Birth-related Legislation Rules, which establish the normative framework within which sex at birth assignments occur.",

    "description" : "The diagram models chromosomes and their role in human cells and persons. At its core, Chromosome is specialized into the subkind Allosome, which is further partitioned into Allosome X and Allosome Y. A note clarifies that an allosome set can never consist of only Y, preventing biologically inconsistent representations. The model enforces that allosome type is complete and disjoint.\n\nHuman cells are classified according to their number of chromosomes as either Diploid Cell or Haploid Cell, in a complete and disjoint partition. Diploid cells incorporate one or more allosomes, whereas haploid cells (including Gametes) contain only one set of chromosomes. The relations use {xor} constraints to ensure mutual exclusivity in chromosome composition. This distinction provides explicit support for modeling gametes as haploid carriers of genetic material.\n\nOn the organismal level, Person is represented as composed of two or more human cells, with specialization according to sex chromosome type. The diagram distinguishes between Person with Regular Sex Chromosome (diploid XX or XY) and Person with Variant Sex Chromosome, allowing the ontology to accommodate individuals with chromosomal variations.",

This intrinsic determination is grounded in the composition of sex chromosomes and is present from birth, independently of later developmental or interpretive factors.\n\nThe model distinguishes between Karyotypical Male and Karyotypical Female, each further divided into Regular and Variant forms. Regular karyotypical males and females correspond to the common chromosomal patterns XY and XX, while variant karyotypes (e.g., XXY, X0, mosaic configurations) capture biological diversity beyond the typical patterns. Both male and female partitions are complete and disjoint, ensuring exhaustive and non-overlapping classification.\n\nAt the level of persons, the ontology separates Person with Regular Sex Chromosome from Person with Variant Sex Chromosome. Each of these types is further specified by the corresponding karyotypical category. Variant cases also include the possibility of a Karyotypical Indeterminate Person, acknowledging that some chromosomal configurations cannot be unambiguously aligned with either the male or female partition.",

Unlike karyotypical sex, phenotypic sex is extrinsic, as it arises through assessment by others rather than being solely determined by genetic makeup. This assessment is represented through the relator Phenotypic Sex Assessment, which mediates the interaction between the Person with Assessed Phenotypic Sex and the Phenotypic Sex Assessor, a role typically played by a healthcare professional.\n\nPersons with assessed phenotypic sex are further specialized into the roles Male Phenotypic Person, Female Phenotypic Person, and Ambiguous Phenotypic Person. These roles are complete and overlapping, reflecting the variability of observable traits and the fact that assessments may not always yield a binary outcome.\n\nThe ontology makes explicit use of Visual Sex Characteristics as the basis for assessment. These are categorized as Male-typical, Female-typical, or Indeterminate Visual Sex Characteristics, providing the cues through which assessments are made. This partition is complete and disjoint, ensuring that each characteristic is classified in exactly one category.",

    "description" : "The diagram models Sex as a biological property that characterizes every Person. In this context, sex is represented as a mode, understood as an intrinsic property grounded in the person’s biological makeup. The ontology acknowledges, however, that biological sex is not a single or unitary concept but rather an umbrella encompassing multiple dimensions, such as chromosomal, gonadal, hormonal, anatomical, and phenotypical aspects.\n\nThe model structures biological sex through three subkinds of persons: Male Biological Person, Female Biological Person, and Indeterminate Biological Person. These roles are distinguished based on the relative number of Sexual Dimorphic Characteristics exhibited by the individual. Such characteristics are further classified as Male-typical, Female-typical, or Indeterminate Dimorphic Characteristics, and together they form the basis for sex classification in the model.\n\nThis classification is simplified, focusing on the count of dimorphic traits without weighting them, while recognizing that in biological and clinical practice, some traits—such as chromosomal constitution, gonadal tissue, or hormonal profiles—may be considered diagnostically more significant than secondary sexual features. Supplementary notes in the model highlight this limitation and indicate that future refinements may include explicit modeling of chromosomes as sexual dimorphic characteristics.\n\nBy organizing sex in this way, the ontology establishes biological sex as a multifaceted construct while situating it within a coherent framework that connects intrinsic features of persons with representative biological dimensions, such as karyotypical, phenotypic, and assigned sex at birth.",

This recognition is formalized in a Legal Gender Recognition Document, and both the recognition and its document are treated as specializations of their administrative recognition counterparts. This frames legal gender as a state-based form of gender recognition.\n\nLegal Gender Recognition recognizes a Person, yielding the classification Person with Recognized Legal Gender, and this person is associated with one or more Legal Gender instances. Persons are also classified under an \"assigned legal gender\" partition that distinguishes recognized legal gender from unassigned legal gender, supporting explicit representation of cases where no legal gender has been assigned.",

    "description" : "The diagram represents the structure and results of diagnostic processes. At the top, a Diagnostic Relation connects diagnosing agents and diagnosed entities. Once a diagnostic process has been completed, this relation becomes a Concluded Diagnostic Relation, which manifests in one or more Diagnostic Assessments. These assessments classify the determination of diagnostic results into complete and disjoint categories.\n\nA Diagnostic Assessment may be Conclusive or Inconclusive. Inconclusive assessments represent cases where the diagnostic process fails to establish a definitive result. Conclusive assessments are subdivided into Negative Diagnosis Assessment and Positive Diagnosis Assessment, each yielding a specific outcome. Negative assessments yield a No-Diagnosis Outcome, while positive assessments yield a Diagnosis. Both outcomes are treated as subkinds of Diagnostic Assessment Outcome, which serves as the general mode representing the result of a diagnostic process.\n\nThe model also includes a connection from Diagnostic Assessment Outcome to the general category Belief, clarifying that diagnostic outcomes are modeled as entities that may ground or manifest beliefs within clinical or biomedical contexts.",

    "description" : "The diagram organizes the ontology of Agents, rooted in the UFO-based category Agent. Agents are understood as entities capable of acting or exercising agency in a system. The diagram distinguishes between collective and individual forms of agency.\n\nOrganization is modeled as a kind of agent that represents collective structures, while Individual Agent is a separate category, further divided into disjoint and complete types. These include Artificial Agent, covering computational or technological systems with agency-like behavior, and Animal, representing biological entities capable of action. Within the biological domain, Person is modeled as a kind of animal, thereby situating human agents within the broader taxonomy of living individual agents.\n\nThe diagram specifies that types of agents as a whole are incomplete and disjoint, clarifying that while the current taxonomy covers key distinctions, the classification is not exhaustive. By contrast, types of individual agents are modeled as complete and disjoint, ensuring that every individual agent must be classified as either artificial or animal, with no overlap.",

    "description" : "The diagram represents the high-level modeling of cellular entities and their relation to broader biological categories. At the core is the category Cellular Entity, which generalizes living beings composed of cells, including both individual organisms and more specific cellular components. This category is specialized according to the complete and disjoint states Living Cellular Entity and Dead Cellular Entity, capturing the essential life-state distinction relevant to medical and biological contexts.\n\nThe diagram makes explicit that cellular entities encompass not only whole organisms but also entities such as fetuses, embryos, and isolated cells. This ensures coverage of cases important for biomedical data integration where early developmental stages and cellular-level entities must be consistently represented.\n\nFrom a taxonomic perspective, Cellular Entity subsumes Animal, which is further divided into the disjoint categories Person and Non-Human Animal. This partition provides a clear distinction between human and non-human subjects in biomedical datasets while preserving their common grounding as cellular entities.",

This relator connects a Diagnosing Agent and a Diagnosed Entity, ensuring that diagnostic activities are explicitly grounded in the participation of both an agent and a target entity.\n\nA diagnostic process may begin with a Diagnosis Suspicion, modeled as a mode and characterized as a specific kind of Belief. Suspicion is always linked to at least one diagnosing agent, capturing the cognitive or inferential basis that motivates the establishment of a diagnostic relation.\n\nDiagnostic relations also involve Diagnostic Methods, which are characterized modes instantiated by a Diagnostic Method Type. This distinction ensures that diagnostic practices are not only recorded at the instance level but also categorized by methodological type, providing traceability of procedures.\n\nOn the side of the diagnosed entity, the diagram shows that each diagnosed entity, modeled as a substantial, can be characterized by one or more Conditions. These conditions, in turn, may be further qualified by Condition Indicators, which capture observable or inferable elements such as symptoms, signs, risk factors, or contextual historical data. A note clarifies that condition indicators can be decomposed into subjective, objective, and contextual categories, offering finer-grained representation of diagnostic evidence.",

The category is further partitioned into two complete and disjoint subtypes: Object and Agent. Objects denote substantial entities that are not capable of agency, while Agents represent substantials that can act or exercise agency. This division provides the ontological basis for distinguishing between passive and active entities in the domain.",

The roles Layperson Diagnosing Agent and Professional Diagnosing Agent are modeled as complete and overlapping, allowing for flexible representation of cases where diagnostic activities may be carried out by professionals (e.g., clinicians) or non-professionals (e.g., self-diagnosis).\n\nIn addition, diagnosing agents are linked to the role mixin Diagnostic Outcome Issuer, ensuring that diagnostic activities are tied to the issuance of outcomes.

    "description" : "The diagram structures the taxonomy of Diagnosis, identifying different types according to their object, focus, source, and use. A general subkind Diagnosis is specialized into Cellular Entity Diagnosis and Healthcare Diagnosis, ensuring coverage of both cellular-level and broader healthcare-oriented diagnostic contexts.\n\nCellular Entity Diagnosis is partitioned into the disjoint types Antemortem Diagnosis and Postmortem Diagnosis, distinguishing whether the diagnostic assessment occurs before or after death. Healthcare Diagnosis is further refined through three complementary classification axes. By focus, diagnoses are divided into Human Healthcare Diagnosis and Veterinary Diagnosis. By source, they are classified into disjoint subtypes such as Clinical Diagnosis, Epidemiological Diagnosis, Laboratory Diagnosis, Administrative Coding Diagnosis, and Radiological Diagnosis. By use, diagnoses are modeled as roles that may overlap: Care-oriented Diagnosis, Surveillance Diagnosis, and Research Diagnosis.\n\nThe model also incorporates the distinction between Self-diagnosis and External Diagnosis. A note clarifies that self-diagnosis applies exclusively when a single individual simultaneously plays both diagnosing agent and diagnosed entity roles. Another annotation highlights that diagnosis types are defined by the method from which they originate, such that diagnoses derived from laboratory methods are classified as laboratory diagnoses.",

    "description" : "The diagram Health Condition Overview provides a high-level structure for representing health conditions and their main distinctions. It introduces Health Condition as a specialization of Condition, associated with Animal entities, and instantiated through Health Condition Types. This establishes the general framework in which health conditions are characterized and classified within the ontology.\n\nThe diagram differentiates health conditions along two principal axes. The first axis concerns pathological status, dividing conditions into pathological and non-pathological types. Pathological Health Condition is further connected to categories such as Disease and Non-traumatic Health Condition, clarifying its scope within the ontology. The second axis addresses the nature of health conditions, separating risk-based conditions from established ones. Risk-based conditions represent probabilities or predispositions, while established conditions represent actual states, ensuring that both preventive and diagnostic perspectives are accounted for.\n\nTogether, these partitions provide a coherent schema for distinguishing between current disorders, risks of future conditions, and the pathological status of health states.",

This is partitioned into four disjoint and complete types, ensuring that all diagnosed entities fall into one of these categories.\n\nThe specialization includes Diagnosed Cellular Entity, which is explicitly linked to the broader biological category of Cellular Entity. This supports the modeling of diagnostic contexts where individual cells, such as tumor cells or infected cells, are the diagnostic target. Diagnosed Biological Part covers organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures subject to diagnosis, while Diagnosed Specimen represents biological samples collected for diagnostic analysis. Finally, Diagnosed Group accounts for diagnoses applied at the collective level, such as patient cohorts or study populations.",

    "description" : "The diagram Established Health Condition Types organizes the classification of health conditions based on structural, functional, psychological, and etiological aspects. It provides a structured view of how different categories of conditions are related, ensuring that all relevant perspectives on health conditions are consistently represented. The model distinguishes between structural and non-structural conditions, including functional and psychological conditions, and connects them to broader classifications of established health conditions. It also incorporates etiological distinctions, such as idiopathic and known-origin conditions, with the latter further divided into congenital and acquired types.\n\nThe diagram additionally addresses dependence types, separating inherent conditions from externally-caused ones. Externally-caused conditions are modeled alongside injuries and exposure-based conditions, reflecting the impact of external influences on health states. Injuries are further divided into traumatic and non-traumatic categories, capturing the role of trauma in their occurrence. This structure ensures that conditions are classified according to both their internal characteristics and their external determinants.\n\nOverall, the diagram provides a comprehensive schema for differentiating established health conditions, using complete and disjoint partitions where appropriate and allowing overlaps where necessary.",

    "description" : "The diagram models the temporal and biological aspects of a person’s existence, capturing both life stages and living status. At its center is the kind Person, which includes an attribute date of birth that records the individual's birth date. A constraint ensures consistency by requiring that the date of birth matches the date portion of the end attribute of the associated Person’s Birth event.\n\nThe diagram distinguishes between two mutually exclusive living states, represented as phases: Living Person and Dead Person. This partition is complete and disjoint, ensuring that every person is classified in one and only one of these states at a time. A living person may transition across the life stages Child, Adolescent, and Adult, also modeled as complete and disjoint phases. Additional constraints clarify that no person can become an adolescent without first being a child, and no person can become an adult without first being an adolescent.\n\nThe Person's Birth event creates the role Offspring, mediated by the Parent-Child Relation. A birth event includes start and end timestamps, the latter aligning with the person's registered date of birth. Conversely, the Person's Death event terminates the individual's life status and is associated with at least one Person's Death Cause. This mode is instantiated by a Person's Death Cause Type, ensuring that every recorded death is explained by an identified cause type.\n\nBy connecting life stages, birth and death events, and cause of death, the diagram provides a coherent framework for modeling the lifecycle of a person within biomedical and demographic contexts.",

    "description" : "The diagram models biological parenthood through the Parent-Child Relation, a relator that mediates the link between persons in parental and offspring roles. At its core, every Person may take on the Child phase, which represents the life stage during which the individual participates as Offspring in a parent–child relation. This mediation ensures that the role of offspring is explicitly tied to a person’s life cycle.\n\nOn the parental side, the relator includes the roles Biological Mother and Biological Father, which are grounded in sexed subkinds of Biological Person. A Biological Mother is mediated by a Male Biological Person, while a Biological Father is mediated by a Female Biological Person. The model specifies that parenthood is always tied to the Parent-Child Relation, ensuring traceability of biological lineage.\n\nMultiplicity constraints ensure that each offspring is connected to one or more parents, while parents may have one or more children. Material relations “is biological mother of” and “is biological father of” capture the concrete grounding of these roles in parent–child structures.\n\nThe diagram also incorporates explicit constraints. (1) A biological mother or father can only be the parent of persons with whom they have a valid parent–child relation. (2) A biological mother or father cannot be their own parent. (3) A biological mother and a biological father cannot be parents of each other. These clarifications prevent logically inconsistent cases, such as self-parenthood or reciprocal parental ties between parents, strengthening the semantic rigor of the model.",

Digital Document covers information encoded in electronic formats, including files, databases, and digitally stored reports. The complete and disjoint constraint ensures that every document must be classified as either physical or digital, with no overlap between the two.\n\nThis distinction supports consistent representation of information artifacts across heterogeneous healthcare and research contexts, enabling explicit modeling of whether information exists in material form or as a digital object.",

Two context-specific person types support modality assignment: Self-aware Person supports self-identified modality types, and Externally Gender-attributed Person supports externally-attributed modality types.\n\nSelf-identified Cisgender Person and Self-identified Transgender Person specialize Self-aware Person as a complete and disjoint classification, while Externally-attributed Cisgender Person and Externally-attributed Transgender Person specialize Externally Gender-attributed Person as a complete and overlapping classification. Cisgender and transgender types are also refined by context, relating self-identified and externally-attributed variants to the broader cisgender and transgender person classifications.",

    "description" : "Sex is treated as a biological classification grounded in distinct dimensions, including chromosomal constitution and observable anatomical features. Persons can be connected to sex classifications that are assessed or recorded, including a recorded classification at birth.\n\nSex is specialized into Karyotypical Sex and Phenotypic Sex as mutually exclusive alternatives, while not asserting that these alternatives are exhaustive. Phenotypic Sex is further specialized by Sex at Birth, emphasizing a phenotypic classification that is recorded at the time of birth. Person is connected to Sex and also connected to Karyotypical Sex, supporting explicit representation of chromosomal and broader sex classifications for a given person. Person with Assessed Phenotypic Sex refines Person for cases where a phenotypic classification has been assessed, and Person with Assigned Sex at Birth refines that assessed category for cases where a sex-at-birth classification is recorded; the link between Person with Assigned Sex at Birth and Sex at Birth is a specialization of the link between Person with Assessed Phenotypic Sex and Phenotypic Sex.",

Gender contexts distinguish Self-identified Gender, Gender Expression, and Externally-attributed Gender, with Administrative Gender and Legal Gender refining Externally-attributed Gender, and the externally-attributed, administrative, and legal partitions allowing overlap. Gender options distinguish Male Gender, Female Gender, and Non-binary Gender.\n\nEach gender context is further specialized into option-specific types that align the context dimension with the option dimension, such as Self-identified Male Gender, Feminine Gender Expression, and Legal Non-binary Gender. Specialization relations are color-coded only to distinguish which generalization set they belong to, and the colors carry no semantic meaning.",

Each case is defined by the conjunction of two conditions: the person is self-identified as female-gender or male-gender, and the person is also classified as having female sex at birth or male sex at birth, respectively. This provides a clear criterion for self-identification-based cisgender classification that depends on both self-identification and a sex-at-birth type.",

Each case is defined by the conjunction of two conditions: the person is externally attributed as female-gender or male-gender, and the person is also classified as having female sex at birth or male sex at birth, respectively. This provides a clear criterion for externally attributed cisgender classification that depends on both an externally attributed gender type and a sex-at-birth type.",

    "description" : "Gender Attribution defines how gender can be attributed to a person by an external agent through an explicit attribution relationship. It captures the roles of the gender attributor and the externally gender-attributed person, and it links the externally gender-attributed person to an externally-attributed gender characterization. Each attribution involves an attributing agent that is distinct from the person to whom gender is attributed, keeping the source of externally-attributed gender statements explicit.\n\nGender Attribution is specialized into Administrative Gender Recognition and Legal Gender Recognition, representing institutional attributions performed by an administrative gender recognizing organization and, more specifically, by a legal gender recognizer. These specializations relate the recognizing party to a recognition instance that connects a person with recognized gender to the corresponding recognized gender type, distinguishing administrative and legal recognition while preserving a shared attribution structure.",

Cisgender and transgender modalities are introduced and then specialized to capture male and female cisgender cases that combine gender characterization and sex-at-birth classification.\n\nPerson with Assigned Sex at Birth has specializations Cisgender Person, Transgender Person, and Person with Indeterminate Sex at Birth; together these specializations are complete, while overlap between them is not excluded. Cisgender Person is specialized into Male Cisgender Person and Female Cisgender Person as mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive alternatives. Male Cisgender Person is specialized under Cisgender Person, Male-gender Person, and Person with Male Sex at Birth, and Female Cisgender Person is specialized under Cisgender Person, Female-gender Person, and Person with Female Sex at Birth, capturing cases where a male or female gender characterization aligns with the corresponding sex-at-birth classification. Transgender Person is also specialized under Person with Determinate Sex at Birth, focusing this modality on cases where the sex-at-birth classification is determinate.",

Recorded assignments can be refined into determinate outcomes and indeterminate outcomes, and determinate outcomes are refined into male and female categories.\n\nPerson is partitioned into Person with Assigned Sex at Birth and Person with Unassigned Sex at Birth as mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive alternatives, supporting explicit representation of the absence of a recorded sex-at-birth assignment. Person with Assigned Sex at Birth is further specialized by Person with Determinate Sex at Birth, and also by Person with Indeterminate Sex at Birth, capturing whether the recorded assignment resolves into a determinate category. Person with Determinate Sex at Birth is partitioned into Person with Male Sex at Birth and Person with Female Sex at Birth as mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive alternatives, representing the two determinate assignment outcomes.",
