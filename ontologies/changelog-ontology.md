### Added

- Added detailed descriptions for multiple classes in the ontology, replacing previously null values to improve clarity and documentation quality.

### Changed

- Updated descriptions for:
  - Roles, relators, and categories related to sex and gender assignments and recognitions (e.g., Person with Assigned Sex at Birth, Legal Gender Recognizer, Administrative Gender Recognizer).
  - Core biological concepts such as Chromosome, Allosome, Human Cell, Karyotypical Sex, Phenotypic Sex, and Sex at Birth.
  - Traits and characteristic categories for sexual and visual dimorphic features.
  - High-level categories like Sex and Gender, including Legal, Administrative, and Identity forms.
  - General concepts including Person, Organization, Government, and Document.
- Improved consistency and clarity across all descriptions to support better understanding in administrative, legal, medical, and ontological contexts.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- Introduced new classes to represent administrative gender assignments:
  - `Person with Male Administrative Gender`
  - `Person with Female Administrative Gender`
  - `Person with Non-binary Administrative Gender`
  - `Male Administrative Gender`, `Female Administrative Gender`, and `Non-binary Administrative Gender`
- Added new generalizations and generalization sets:
  - Generalizations linking `Person with Administrative Gender` roles to `Person`
  - Generalizations linking administrative gender phases to the `Administrative Gender` category
  - Generalization sets:
    - `person's administrative genders` (complete, not disjoint)

- Added names to several previously unnamed relations, such as `"has administrative gender"`

### Changed

- Swapped internal OntoUML element IDs to improve structural clarity and align with internal conventions. These changes affect class and generalization identifiers but not their semantic content.
- Improved the clarity of modeling administrative gender recognition as separate from legal or self-identified gender representations.
- Reorganized the ontology structure to accommodate the new administrative gender module while preserving backward compatibility.

### Fixed

- Corrected some inconsistencies in generalization references and alignment of identifiers for relations and generalizations across the administrative gender module.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-07-30

### Changed

- Reassigned internal OntoUML element identifiers to improve structural consistency and tooling traceability:
  - Multiple `id` values for classes, generalizations, and relations were systematically rotated or swapped.
  - These changes have no impact on the logical content or semantics of the ontology but support improved internal alignment.

### Removed

- Class: `Organization` (previously defined as a `kind`) was removed from the ontology.
  - It included a description as a structured group with roles, responsibilities, and formal authority.
  - If still needed, its usage should be reintroduced in future updates or considered as part of an external reference ontology.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- Introduced a new diagnostic module with comprehensive modeling of diagnostic types and roles, including:
  - `Healthcare Diagnosis`, `Clinical Diagnosis`, `Laboratory Diagnosis`, `Radiological Diagnosis`, `Administrative Coding Diagnosis`, `Epidemiological Diagnosis`, `Surveillance Diagnosis`, `Research Diagnosis`
  - Diagnosis roles such as `Diagnosed Biological Part`, `Diagnosed Specimen`, `Diagnosed Group`, and `Diagnosed Cellular Entity`
  - `Conclusive Diagnostic Assessment`, `Concluded Diagnostic Relation`, and other related constructs
- New taxonomy and generalization sets for diagnosis classification, including:
  - `healthcare diagnosis types by source`, `healthcare diagnosis types by focus`, `healthcare diagnosis types by use`, `types of diagnosed entities`, and `cellular entity diagnosis types`
- Introduced `Self-diagnosis`, `External Diagnosis`, and `Diagnosis Suspicion` as distinct classes
- New diagnostic relation: characterization between diagnosis suspicion and assessed condition
- Expanded health condition classification with:
  - `Traumatic Health Condition`, `Non-traumatic Health Condition`, `Risk-based Health Condition`, `Exposure-based Health Condition`, `Inherent Health Condition`, and `Injury`
- Introduced `Cellular Entity` and its states: `Living Cellular Entity`, `Dead Cellular Entity`
- New generalization sets for animal types, trauma-based health condition types, and cellular entity states

### Changed

- Replaced `Animal`, `Non-Human Animal`, `Living Animal`, and `Dead Animal` with an updated and more expressive `Cellular Entity` taxonomy
- Revised several stereotypes:
  - Changed various `subkind` and unnamed classes to proper `category`, `roleMixin`, or `phaseMixin` stereotypes
  - Updated `Health Condition` classes to clarify their nature (e.g., intrinsic vs extrinsic modes)
- Improved modeling coherence for diagnostic processes, replacing older concepts like `Antemortem Diagnosis` and `Postmortem Diagnosis` with more granular and categorized alternatives

### Removed

- Removed the entire `Animal` classification block including:
  - `Animal`, `Non-Human Animal`, `Living Animal`, `Dead Animal`
  - Their generalizations and generalization sets (e.g., `animal types`, `animal living state`)

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- New textual descriptions were added to key sections of the ontology and diagrams, improving documentation and understandability:
  - Ontology-level description of sex and gender, distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic modes and their role in formal assessment or self-identification.
  - Detailed diagram descriptions for:
    - **Sex at Birth**, **Karyotypical Sex**, **Phenotypic Sex**
    - **Legal Gender**, **Administrative Gender**, **Gender Identity**
    - Integrated overview diagram of all sex and gender modes
    - Biological **Sex** as a conceptual umbrella

### Changed

- Swapped internal identifiers of several classes and generalizations to align with structural or tooling needs. These include:
  - Various class IDs for `Person`, `Gender`, `Health Condition`, and diagnostic modules
  - Generalization and generalization set IDs (e.g., in "healthcare diagnosis types by use", "by focus", etc.)
- These identifier changes do not affect the semantic content of the model but improve consistency and traceability in tooling pipelines.

### Fixed

- Improved alignment and phrasing in existing class descriptions for **Gender** and **Sex**, especially in the documentation layer.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-30

### Changed

- Updated internal identifiers (`id` fields) for multiple classes, relations, and generalizations to improve consistency in serialization and downstream processing. These changes do not affect the logical structure or semantics of the ontology.

### Fixed

- Corrected typographic artifacts in textual descriptions for sex and gender constructs that previously used escaped HTML-like formatting (`**<<mode>>**`, `**<<phase>>**`, etc.). These are now consistently rendered.
- Minor cleanup in markdown-style syntax within descriptions, ensuring accurate rendering in downstream documentation tools.

## [0.9.2] - 2025-09-02

### Added

- Expanded the allowed `restrictedTo` values for several constructs:
  - Beyond `functional-complex`, now explicitly includes `collective`, `quantity`, `relator`, `intrinsic-mode`, `extrinsic-mode`, and `quality`.
- Introduced `restrictedTo` constraints to clarify permissible ontological kinds.

### Changed

- Updated `isExtensional` values from `null` to explicit `false` for improved clarity in multiple classes.
- Adjusted internal identifiers (`id` fields) for consistency across classes, relations, and generalizations.

### Fixed

- Corrected the stereotypes of three classes, changing them from `role` to `subkind` to better reflect their ontological nature.

### Added

- Multiple new ontology constructs introduced, including:
  - Additional health condition types and refinements of diagnostic categories
  - New generalization sets expanding classification coverage
  - Supplemental relations between diagnostic entities and health conditions

### Removed

- Deprecated constructs and outdated classification elements that overlapped with the new health condition and diagnostic modules.

### Changed

- Adjusted internal identifiers (`id` fields) to maintain serialization consistency after the additions and removals.
- Updated generalization structures to align with the refined health condition taxonomy.

  - New object properties: `createsOnBehalfOf` (agent → recognizing organization) and `parentOf` (person → person).
- Agent/document taxonomy:
  - `IndividualAgent` (category) introduced; `ArtificialAgent` and `Person` now refine under it.

### Changed

- Clarified and consolidated definitions using `owl:equivalentClass` partitions (e.g., for `Allosome`, `DiagnosedEntity`, `DiagnosingAgent`, `HealthcareDiagnosis`, `HealthCondition`) without altering intended semantics.
- Textual improvements to multiple `rdfs:comment` notes for precision and consistency (e.g., administrative/legal gender recognition patterns, agent/document scopes).

### Removed

## [0.11.6] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- Ontology metadata for release `0.11.6`:
  - `owl:versionIRI`, `owl:versionInfo`, `dcterms:modified`, and `dcterms:conformsTo` links to `v0.11.6/json` and `v0.11.6/vpp`.

- Temporal value model (refactor and extensions):
  - Introduced `OffsetDateTime` (as a `gufo:QualityValue`) with documented constraints for calendar fields, including explicit allowance of `second = 60` only to represent a leap second.
  - Introduced `Month` as an enumerated value type with individuals `January` … `December`.
  - New properties tied to the refactor:
    - `date` (object property; domain `OffsetDateTime`, range `Date`).
    - `utcOffsetMinutes` and `nanosecond` (data properties on `OffsetDateTime`).

- Documentation:
  - Rich `rdfs:comment` added for `OffsetDateTime` describing field ranges (year/month/day, leap-year rules, hour/minute/second, fractional second precision) and timezone offset format.

### Changed

- Temporal properties and ranges/domains aligned to the new model:
  - `start` / `end`: range changed from `Timestamp` to `OffsetDateTime`.
  - `hour`, `minute`, `second`: domain changed from `Timestamp` to `OffsetDateTime`.
  - `year`: domain changed from `Timestamp` to `Date`.
  - `month`: **now an object property** to `Month` (previously `xsd:int`).

- Diagnostic/sex-related formalizations:
  - Minor refinements to partitions/disjointness/equivalences across diagnostic outcomes (`Diagnosis` vs `NoDiagnosisOutcome`), karyotypical classes, and dimorphic characteristics; definitions tightened without changing intended semantics.

- Textual improvements:
  - Clarified wording in several `rdfs:comment` notes across diagnosing agents/persons, gender/sex facets, and health condition groupings for precision and consistency.

### Removed

- Legacy temporal artifacts deprecated by the refactor:
  - `day_1` and `month_1` (duplicate integer-valued properties on `Timestamp`).
  - The prior integer-valued `month` (`xsd:int`) property on `Timestamp` (fully replaced by the object property to `Month`).

## [0.11.7] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- Ontology metadata for release `0.11.7`:
  - `owl:versionIRI`, `owl:versionInfo`, `dcterms:modified`, and `dcterms:conformsTo` links to `v0.11.7/json` and `v0.11.7/vpp`.

- Documentation:
  - Additional `rdfs:comment` clarifications on `Date`, `Month`, and `OffsetDateTime` retained and cross-checked (field ranges, leap-year rules, offset semantics).

### Removed

- No classes were removed in this release.

## [0.11.8] - 2025-10-28

### Changed

- Applied the **UML Note Classification (color coding)** policy across the ontology diagrams in the Visual Paradigm model:
  - All notes now follow the standardized categories (**SEMI**, **CNST**, **RATL**, **SCOP**, **TRAC**, **EXMP**, **TODO**) with the prescribed colors and formatting.
  - This is a **visual/editorial** update only and does **not** change the ontology’s logical content.

### Not serialized

- Note colors and formatting are editor metadata and are **not exported** to the `.json` or `.ttl` artifacts.
  They are visible only in the **`.vpp`** (OntoUML/Visual Paradigm) model.
