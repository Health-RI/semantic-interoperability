# Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative

This repository hosts the source files for the [Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative documentation site](https://health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability/), which presents our approach to enabling semantic interoperability in health and life sciences.

Visit the documentation: [health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability](https://health-ri.github.io/semantic-interoperability/)

## About

The initiative supports the development of shared ontologies and mappings to align heterogeneous data sources conceptually and semantically. Key components include:

- OntoUML as modeling foundation, and gUFO as main computational artifact,
- A structured methodology for modeling and mapping,
- A publishing strategy with versioned OWL and OntoUML artifacts,
- Guidance for contributors, including forms for feedback and extension requests.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Markdown files for the GitHub Pages site (built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)).
- `ontologies/`: Versioned OntoUML and OWL files, diagrams, and changelogs.
