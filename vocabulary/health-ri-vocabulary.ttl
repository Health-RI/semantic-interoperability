    dct:title "Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary"@en ;
    dct:abstract "A vocabulary by Health-RI defining mapping properties (hriv:hasSemantics, hriv:hasSemanticsBroad, hriv:hasSemanticsNarrow) to express semantic alignments between external artifacts and the Health-RI Ontology. It supports exact, broader, and narrower meaning links for cross-scheme alignment without asserting OWL logical equivalence."@en ;
    dct:description "This vocabulary is part of the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative. It provides properties for aligning local concepts to reference concepts in the Health-RI Ontology, enabling non-invasive mappings (e.g., via SSSOM) or embedded annotations in ontologies."@en ;

It is used when an expression's semantics are unambiguously and exclusively defined by a specific meaning.

Unlike owl:equivalentClass—which asserts full logical equivalence between two classes—this property is meant to capture a definitional relation between an expression and a meaning. It conveys semantic definition without declaring classes to be interchangeable under all logical inferences. While the former establishes full semantic equivalence between classes, enabling bi-directional inference of class membership, the latter models a one-way definitional relation from an expression to a meaning, rather than interchangeability of classes.

This property also differs conceptually from skos:exactMatch. skos:exactMatch serves to align semantically similar concepts across systems (potentially without shared logic), indicating that two concepts may be used interchangeably across vocabularies without guaranteeing logical equivalence. hriv:hasSemantics encodes a precise, definitional link—the expression’s semantics are directly and unambiguously defined by the associated meaning."""@en ;
