# Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative

This site documents how Health-RI achieves semantic interoperability across health and life-sciences data: our concepts, modeling foundations (OntoUML & gUFO), the method and mapping vocabulary we use, and the published ontology deliverables (specs, docs, changelog).

## About Health-RI

[Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl) is a national initiative in the Netherlands dedicated to building an integrated infrastructure for health and life sciences data. By improving data sharing, reuse, and accessibility, Health-RI aims to empower researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to accelerate data-driven healthcare innovation.

Semantic interoperability plays a foundational role in this mission by ensuring that data from diverse sources can be aligned and understood consistently — not just technically, but conceptually.

## Who this is for
Data stewards, modelers, and engineers who need stable, shared meaning across systems—using a common reference model (OntoUML → gUFO) and mappings that align external ontologies to it.
