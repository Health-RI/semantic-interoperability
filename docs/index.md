# Health-RI: Semantic Interoperability

Welcome to the official documentation site for semantic interoperability within the Health-RI ecosystem.

This site serves as a central resource for:
- Understanding what **semantic interoperability** is and why it matters,
- Learning about **ontologies** and **ontology engineering** approaches,
- Exploring **OntoUML** and **gUFO**, the modeling foundations selected for our efforts,
- Documenting the **method** developed and applied at Health-RI to achieve semantic integration across datasets and systems.

## About Health-RI

[Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl) is a national initiative in the Netherlands dedicated to building an integrated infrastructure for health and life sciences data. By improving data sharing, reuse, and accessibility, Health-RI aims to empower researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to accelerate data-driven healthcare innovation.

Semantic interoperability plays a foundational role in this mission by ensuring that data from diverse sources can be aligned and understood consistently â€” not just technically, but conceptually.

### What You'll Find Here

This site documents Health-RI's efforts to enable semantic interoperability in health data by providing foundational concepts, modeling techniques, and methodological guidance. It is designed to support researchers, data stewards, and engineers working to align data meaningfully across systems.
