# Health-RI: Semantic Interoperability

Welcome to the official documentation site for semantic interoperability within the Health-RI ecosystem.

This site serves as a central resource for:
- Understanding what **semantic interoperability** is and why it matters,
- Learning about **ontologies** and **ontology engineering** approaches,
- Exploring **OntoUML** and **gUFO**, the modeling foundations selected for our efforts,
- Documenting the **method** developed and applied at Health-RI to achieve semantic integration across datasets and systems.

## About Health-RI

[Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl) is a national initiative in the Netherlands dedicated to building an integrated infrastructure for health and life sciences data. By improving data sharing, reuse, and accessibility, Health-RI aims to empower researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to accelerate data-driven healthcare innovation.

Semantic interoperability plays a foundational role in this mission by ensuring that data from diverse sources can be aligned and understood consistently â€” not just technically, but conceptually.

### What You'll Find Here

This documentation provides:
- Conceptual overviews and definitions,
- Practical modeling guidelines,
- Descriptions of the Health-RI methodology,
- Examples of semantic alignment in real-world use cases.

We invite researchers, data stewards, engineers, and anyone working with structured health data to explore this site and contribute to building a more interoperable health data ecosystem.
