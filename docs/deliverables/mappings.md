# Health-RI SSSOM Mapping Set

<!-- [Download the full SSSOM mapping.](../../mappings/health-ri-mappings.tsv) -->

!!! note "Scope"
    This page **visualizes** the mappings that already exist. For the Mapping Set's schema and stable PIDs, see the **[SSSOM Mapping Set](../method/mapping-schema.md)**.

!!! tip "Need help mapping your terms to HRIO?"
    Use the **[HRIO Mapping Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6990a7e348c4819190ef2de88503ff5e-hrio-mapping-assistant)** to draft candidate mappings (one HRIV predicate + confidence + evidence snippets):

    *Drafting aid only — contributed mappings must still follow the schema rules and the governance/review process.*
