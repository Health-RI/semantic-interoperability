# Deliverables Overview

This section presents the **outcomes of the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative**.
Here you will find the concrete artifacts that have been produced, maintained, and released as part of the Initiative:

- **Health-RI Ontology (HRIO)** – a common semantic reference model specified in OntoUML and implemented as a gUFO-based OWL ontology, providing a machine-processable semantic hub for aligning health and life sciences data.
- **Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary (HRIV)** – an intentional (definitional) mapping vocabulary in OWL defining meaning-mapping relations that explicitly capture ontological commitments (e.g., `hriv:hasExactMeaning`, `hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan`, `hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan`).
- **SSSOM Mapping Set** – a curated set of semantic mappings expressed in [SSSOM](https://w3id.org/sssom/) format, linking external ontologies and models to HRIO using HRIV meaning-mapping relations to enable consistent data integration.

Supporting pages in this section include:

- **Ontology Documentation and Specification** – the full reference, generated automatically from the ontology.
- **Mapping Set** – the downloadable and browsable set of mappings.
- **Changelog** – a record of changes across HRIO, HRIV, and mapping releases, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Together, these deliverables form the foundation of semantic alignment across Health-RI and provide reusable resources for the broader community.
