### Landscape analysis
This involves the analysis of similar and related initiatives and models.

**Cancer Image Europe (EUCAIM) hyper-ontology**
[EUCAIM](https://cancerimage.eu/) is pioneering a pan-European federated infrastructure for cancer images, fueling AI innovations. It addresses semantic interoperability challenges among distributed data repositories that use heterogeneous cancer image data models through a semantically well-founded domain ontology for the oncology domain. To enable federated querying across these repositories, the integration of a semantic interoperability layer is required. The so-called [EUCAIM hyper-ontology](https://cancerimage.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/D5.2-EUCAIM-CDM-and-Hyper-Ontology.pdf) is a common semantic meta-model that aims to support and maintain semantic interoperability among heterogeneous cancer image data models/standard. Using the hyper-ontology, the real-world meaning of essential medical and imaging data/metadata is preserved and exchanged in a standardized, consistent, and meaningful way. Its core layer and upper layer are based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) with links to HL7 minimal Common Oncology Data Elements ([mCODE](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig/)).
