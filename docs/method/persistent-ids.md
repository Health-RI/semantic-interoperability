# Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)

This page lists the **persistent, stable, and dereferenceable identifiers (PIDs)** established by the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative. These URIs support semantic interoperability, long-term accessibility, and alignment with FAIR principles.

## Initiative-Wide Identifier

### URI: `https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability`

This URI refers to the Semantic Interoperability Initiative as a whole. It provides persistent access to the initiative’s public-facing resources and is suitable for citing the initiative in publications, websites, and metadata records.

## Ontology Identifier

### URI: `https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology`

This is the **main identifier for the Health-RI Ontology**, which always resolves to the ontology's most recent version.

### Identifiers for the **Latest Ontology Version**

These URIs point to the **most recent release** of the Health-RI Ontology and related documentation formats.

| PID                       | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/ontology/ttl`           | OWL ontology in Turtle format                |
| `/ontology/specification` | HTML rendering of the ontology specification |
| `/ontology/documentation` | Markdown documentation (raw version)         |
| `/ontology/json`          | OntoUML model exported as JSON               |
| `/ontology/vpp`           | OntoUML model file in Visual Paradigm format |

Each of these URIs redirects to the latest available version of the resource.

!!! tip
    You can use either `/doc` or `/documentation`, and `/spec` or `/specification` — both forms are valid and equivalent.

### Identifiers for **Versioned Ontology Releases**

To support traceability and reproducibility, each ontology release is also available via **version-specific URIs**. Each versioned release of the Health-RI Ontology is identified by its own dedicated URI in the format **`https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/vX.Y.Z`**. This URI is used as the `owl:versionIRI` in the ontology metadata.

#### Format

`https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/vX.Y.Z/{format}`

Where:

- `X.Y.Z` is the semantic version (e.g., `2.0.0`)
- `{format}` is one of:
  - `ttl` — OWL ontology (Turtle)
  - `vpp` — OntoUML model (Visual Paradigm)
  - `json` — OntoUML model (JSON)
  - `documentation` — Markdown documentation
  - `specification` — HTML specification

!!! tip
    You can also use the version URI without a `{format}` (e.g., `/v0.6.0`) to directly access the `.ttl` file.

#### Examples

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/ttl`
  → Ontology in Turtle format for version 0.6.0

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/vpp`
  → Visual Paradigm project file for version 0.6.0

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.9.1/documentation`
  → Markdown documentation for version 0.9.1

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/specification`
  → HTML specification for version 0.6.0

## SSSOM Mappings PIDs

The following PIDs provide **stable access to the latest SSSOM mapping set** produced by the initiative, in both Turtle (TTL) and TSV formats.

### Latest Mappings

- **URI (default/TTL):**
  `https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings`
  *(also available explicitly as `/mappings/ttl`)*

- **URI (TSV):**
  `https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings/tsv`

These PIDs redirect to the canonical files in the Health-RI GitHub repository (branch `main`), ensuring that citations remain stable while the underlying files can be updated as needed.

#### Examples

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings`
  → Latest SSSOM mappings in Turtle (`.ttl`)

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings/tsv`
  → Latest SSSOM mappings in TSV (`.tsv`)

## Mapping Vocabulary PIDs

The **Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary** defines terms used in our mapping work. The PIDs below provide stable access to the latest vocabulary and to versioned snapshots.

### Latest Vocabulary

- **URI (TTL):**
  `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary`
  *(also available explicitly as `/mapping-vocabulary/ttl`)*

- **URI (HTML specification):**
  `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary/specification`
  *(alias: `/mapping-vocabulary/spec`)*

!!! tip
    Both `/spec` and `/specification` are valid and equivalent for the vocabulary specification.

#### Examples

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary`
  → Latest vocabulary in Turtle (`.ttl`)

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary/spec`
  → Latest HTML specification

### Versioned Vocabulary

Versioned PIDs follow semantic versioning and resolve to immutable artifacts for that release.

- **URI (TTL):**
  `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary/vX.Y.Z`
  *(also available explicitly as `/vX.Y.Z/ttl`)*

- **URI (HTML specification):**
  `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary/vX.Y.Z/specification`
  *(alias: `/vX.Y.Z/spec`)*

#### Examples

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary/v1.0.0`
  → Vocabulary in Turtle for version `v1.0.0`

- `https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary/v1.0.0/spec`
  → HTML specification for version `v1.0.0`
