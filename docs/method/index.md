# The Health-RI Method

The **Health-RI Method** section provides a structured overview of how semantic interoperability is achieved and maintained within the Health-RI initiative. It outlines the principles, practices, and technical resources that support the creation, publication, and use of our artifacts.

Readers will find here:

- **Overview** – a high-level introduction to the method and its role in enabling semantic interoperability.
- **Mapping Strategy** – the conceptual and practical approach used to align internal and external ontologies, including how mappings are represented and validated.
- **Mapping Set** – the concrete collection of mappings provided by Health-RI, with guidance on their structure, maintenance, and application.
- **Persistent Identifiers** – the policy and practices behind persistent and resolvable identifiers for ontologies, vocabularies, and mappings.
- **Publications** – details on release and versioning practices, including how specifications and ontology files are published and referenced over time.

Together, these pages form the methodological backbone of our semantic interoperability initiative. They explain not only **what** artifacts are available, but also **how** they are developed, governed, and kept FAIR for the health and life sciences community.
