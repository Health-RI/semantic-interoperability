### Versioning Policy

We use an **adapted semantic versioning** scheme to indicate the type and impact of changes:

**Format**: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

- **Major**: Conceptual milestones or structural overhauls.
- **Minor**: Any scoped modifications, including additions, refinements, or reorganizations that preserve semantic compatibility.
- **Patch**: Fixes or clarifications that stay within the established scope (e.g., label corrections, comment improvements).

While inspired by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), this adapted strategy is tailored for ontology and conceptual model management.

!!! note
    Only **major versions** will trigger a formal release and will have a corresponding published specification webpage. These releases are considered **stable versions**, and intended for broader reuse and citation.

!!! info
    We adopt a **fast versioning strategy**: files are made available in the `/ontology` folder as soon as possible, even when they may present smaller completion or consistency issues. This enables early access and collaboration, while stability is guaranteed only for major releases.
