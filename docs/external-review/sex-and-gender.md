# Sex and Gender

This page is for the external review of the **Sex and Gender** package in the Health-RI Ontology (HRIO), developed within the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative.

Your feedback helps improve:

- conceptual clarity and modeling decisions
- documentation usability for both domain experts and implementers

## What you are reviewing

HRIO is published as two complementary artifacts:

- **HRIO OntoUML (conceptual model)**: a human-oriented representation of the intended meaning and modeling commitments.
- **HRIO gUFO/OWL (OWL implementation)**: a machine-processable ontology that implements the same intended meaning.

In one sentence: the documentation shows and explains the package diagrams and narrative (OntoUML), while the specification provides the OWL package content with class-level descriptions (gUFO/OWL).

!!! tip "Recommended review flow"

    1. Read the package diagrams and narrative in the documentation.
    2. Cross-check the OWL package in the specification (class IRIs and descriptions).
    3. If you find a mismatch, report it and include the diagram name and the class IRI.

Recommended review flow: start with the documentation, then cross-check the specification.

For this package specifically (linked below):

- **Diagrams and the package narrative** are presented and described in the documentation.
- **Class-level descriptions** are available in the specification.

!!! warning "Scope of this external review"

    The documentation and specification pages also show other HRIO packages. These are at lower maturity levels and are not open for external review at this moment. Please focus your review on the Sex and Gender package only.
