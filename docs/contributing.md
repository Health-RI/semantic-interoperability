# Contributing to the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Effort

We welcome community feedback and contributions to help us improve the quality, coverage, and clarity of the models and ontologies developed as part of Health-RI's semantic interoperability initiative.

This page outlines the available ways to contribute and provides structured submission forms to ensure that your input is handled efficiently and consistently.

## Contribution Channels

You can contribute to this effort by submitting one of the following types of input:

### 1. Report an Error in the OntoUML or gUFO Ontology

If you identify an error, inconsistency, ambiguity, or omission in any of the semantic artifacts (including diagrams, models, or OWL files), please let us know.

[Submit an Ontology Error Report](https://github.com/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/issues/new?template=ontology-error-report.yml)

Typical reports may include:

- Incorrect use of stereotypes or relations
- Mislabeled or ambiguous classes
- Discrepancies between diagrams and OWL implementation
- Logical contradictions or violations of ontological principles

### 2. Request a New Concept to Be Added

If you believe a concept is missing from the ontology and should be included (e.g., a new domain-specific class or relation), please use the form below to propose it.

[Request a New Concept](https://github.com/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/issues/new?template=concept-request.yml)

Your request should ideally include:

- A clear label and definition for the proposed concept
- Its relevance within the Health-RI context
- References, standards, or examples supporting the need for this concept

### 3. Other Contributions or Collaboration Requests

For all other types of contributions—including documentation suggestions, collaboration offers, use case proposals, or questions about modeling and alignment—please use the general-purpose form below.

[Submit a General Contribution or Request](https://github.com/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/issues/new?template=other-contribution.yml)

Examples of valid submissions:

- Proposing a new use case to guide modeling efforts
- Requesting clarification about specific OntoUML patterns
- Suggesting improvements to model documentation
- Offering to align a dataset with the reference ontology

## Submission Process

Each of the forms linked above will guide you through the required fields. Submissions are publicly visible as GitHub Issues in our repository and are reviewed regularly by the modeling and coordination teams.

By submitting, you agree to have your contributions used in future releases of the model and/or documentation. Attribution will be provided where applicable.
