**OntoUML** is an ontologically well-founded language designed for ontology-driven conceptual modeling. It extends the Unified Modeling Language (UML) by incorporating the ontological distinctions provided by the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). Through UML’s profiling mechanism, OntoUML defines a collection of class and association stereotypes that reflect the ontological distinctions present in UFO. It also establishes semantically motivated syntactical constraints to ensure that every syntactically correct model represents a sound UFO-based ontology.

## Origins and Foundations

The development of OntoUML is rooted in the work of Giancarlo Guizzardi, particularly his Ph.D. thesis titled [*Ontological Foundations for Structural Conceptual Models*](https://research.utwente.nl/files/6042428/thesis_Guizzardi.pdf) **<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>**. In this work, Guizzardi proposed the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) as a novel foundational ontology for conceptual modeling and employed it to evaluate and redesign a fragment of the UML 2.0 metamodel. This effort aimed to enhance conceptual modeling and domain ontology engineering by providing a more rigorous ontological foundation.

## Adoption and Influence

Since its inception, OntoUML has been adopted by various academic, corporate, and governmental institutions worldwide for developing conceptual models across diverse domains. The foundational theories underlying OntoUML have also influenced other conceptual modeling languages, such as ORM 2.0.

Several research groups have contributed to the development and dissemination of OntoUML, including:

- The Ontology & Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO) at the Federal University of Espírito Santo
- The Conceptual and Cognitive Modelling Research Group (CORE) at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano
- The Center for Conceptual Modelling and Implementation (CCMi) at the Faculty of Information Technology
- The Semantics, Cybersecurity & Services (SCS) group at the University of Twente

## Supporting Tools and Developments

OntoUML's ecosystem includes various tools and resources to support modeling activities:

- **OntoUML/UFO Catalog**: A comprehensive catalog of OntoUML and UFO ontology models, serving as a robust, structured, and open-source platform for ontology-driven conceptual modeling research.
- **OpenPonk**: An open-source platform for modeling and simulation that supports OntoUML.
- **Tonto**: A tool designed to facilitate OntoUML modeling.
- **OntoUML-JS**: A JavaScript-based library for working with OntoUML models.
- **OntoUML Vocabulary**: Provides a formal vocabulary for OntoUML concepts.
- **OntoUML Schema**: Defines the schema for OntoUML models.
- **OntoUML Json2Graph Decoder**: A tool for converting JSON representations of OntoUML models into graph structures.

These tools aim to enhance the usability and applicability of OntoUML in various modeling scenarios.
