# OntoUML & gUFO

This section introduces **OntoUML** and **gUFO**, two complementary components that form the foundation for ontology-driven conceptual modeling.

## What You Will Find Here

- **OntoUML**  
  An ontologically well-founded modeling language that extends UML with precise distinctions inspired by the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). It supports the creation of conceptual models that are semantically rich and logically consistent.

- **gUFO (gentle UFO)**  
  A formal OWL 2 implementation of the core concepts of UFO, designed to support ontology-based data integration, knowledge representation, and semantic interoperability across systems.

## Why These Tools Matter

OntoUML and gUFO are used together to bridge the gap between conceptual modeling and semantic technologies. Their combination enables:

- More precise communication of domain knowledge
- Better model validation and reasoning
- Interoperability across heterogeneous systems

Together, they support the development of models that are not just syntactically valid but also **ontologically sound**.
