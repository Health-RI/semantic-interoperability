# gUFO: A Friendly Introduction

<p align="left"><img src="assets/images/gufo-logo.png" width="400" alt="gUFO Logo"></p>

**gUFO** (gentle Unified Foundational Ontology) is a simplified and lightweight version of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). It was designed to make ontology-driven conceptual modeling more accessible and practical for real-world applications, while preserving the formal rigor of its parent ontology.

## What is gUFO?

gUFO provides a set of foundational building blocks—such as `Object`, `Event`, `Quality`, and `Situation`—that help structure knowledge in a clear and shared way. These concepts are intended to be reused across different domains, helping organizations align their understanding of data and concepts.

Put simply, gUFO is a toolkit for creating consistent and precise representations of meaning.

## Why was gUFO created?

UFO is rich and comprehensive, but its complexity can be a barrier for practical adoption. To address this, gUFO was introduced in 2019 as a lightweight version of UFO. It focuses on usability, compatibility with existing tools, and ease of adoption for systems that need formal grounding without the burden of full ontological complexity.

The goal was to support knowledge graph creation, semantic data integration, and model interoperability in a more approachable way <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.

## Where is gUFO used?

gUFO has found applications in various fields:

- **Semantic interoperability** across organizations and systems
- **Knowledge graphs** for structured web data and enterprise data integration
- **Ontology engineering** and conceptual modeling in research and industry
- **Linked data** and Semantic Web technologies
- **Education**, as a stepping stone to foundational ontologies

Its use has been documented in both academic and applied settings across domains such as public health, digital humanities, software engineering, and e-government <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.

## When was gUFO developed?

gUFO was released in 2019 by João Paulo A. Almeida, Giancarlo Guizzardi, Tiago Prince Sales, and Ricardo A. Falbo. It is built on more than a decade of research on UFO and its application in ontology-driven conceptual modeling <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.

## How does gUFO work?

gUFO is implemented in OWL 2 DL, which means it can be used with standard ontology tools and reasoners. Its key features include:

- **Reusable core categories** grounded in formal ontology
- **Interoperability** with tools and linked data ecosystems
- **Simplified structure** focused on structural (not behavioral) aspects
- **Extendibility**, allowing users to specialize concepts for their domains

This balance between formality and simplicity makes gUFO ideal for organizations aiming to adopt semantic technologies without starting from scratch.
