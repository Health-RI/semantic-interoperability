# Contributing to the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative

We welcome community feedback and contributions to help improve the quality, coverage, and clarity of the models and ontologies developed as part of the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative.

To streamline the contribution process, we distinguish between time-bound calls for community review of specific domain models and ongoing contribution channels. These are described in more detail in the **[Call for Community Review](call-for-community-review.md)** and **[Contribution Channels](contribution-channels.md)** pages, respectively.

To respond to a time-bound **Call for Community Review**, use the link below:

For the general case, you can contribute at any time using the **structured submission forms** below, which help ensure your input is reviewed and addressed efficiently. Choose one of the options to open the appropriate GitHub Issue form:
