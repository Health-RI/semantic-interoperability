They are applied in diverse contexts, from hospital records to research infrastructures. To enable effective data reuse, the data within these systems often needs to be exchanged, compared, and integrated. In other words, the data must be interoperable (fulfilling the \"I\" in FAIR).</p> <p>But achieving this is technically complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors when relying on case-by-case mappings between standards. In the past, several initiatives have sought to address this challenge, and while they brought valuable contributions, some unintentionally added to the creation of a \"standard #15,\" resulting in another model in an already crowded landscape.</p> <p> Source: xkcd.com/927</p> <p>Important efforts such as FHIR, OpenEHR, SNOMED CT, OMOP, and convergence initiatives between them remain crucial endeavors for interoperability, and our work builds directly on them while taking a distinct perspective.</p> <p>The Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative addresses this challenge by developing a unifying upper-level ontology that defines the precise meaning of key concepts already present in widely used standards such as FHIR, OMOP, and OpenEHR. This ontology serves as a shared reference point, allowing existing standards to map their concepts to it. Through this mapping, the intended meanings become clear and explicit to anyone who needs to interoperate across systems.</p> <p>We do not intend to replace the standards and models already in use, into which research groups and institutions have invested significant effort and resources. Instead, our approach replaces the need for multiple pairwise mappings between those standards with a single, reusable mapping to our ontology.</p> <p>This makes the Health-RI Semantic Interoperability Initiative non-intrusive: the ontology complements existing efforts and provides the semantic backbone that supports their interoperability. We know this is complex and ambitious work, but once a mapping is created it can be applied consistently across different projects and contexts. By relying on solid theoretical foundations and state-of-the-art technologies, and by working together as a community, we are confident that we can turn this work into a practical means for achieving semantic interoperability.</p> <p>At this early stage, as we continue to explore alternatives and collaborations, we are already receiving valuable support and feedback from academics and professionals across Health-RI and the broader health data community. Their perspectives are helping us shape the work and ensure it stays aligned with ongoing national and international efforts toward interoperability.</p> <p>We invite you to explore the resources we are making available \u2014 including our ontology, mapping vocabulary, and mapping sets \u2014 all of which are openly published and continuously improved.</p> <p>We also welcome direct engagement, whether through sharing feedback, proposing new mappings, or discussing use cases and potential applications with us.</p> <p>After all, semantic interoperability can only be achieved through the community: initiatives earn trust only when they are built openly and collaboratively. Together, we can ensure this effort translates into real, lasting improvements in how health data is shared and reused.</p>"},{"location":"#about-health-ri","title":"About Health-RI","text":"<p>Health-RI is a national initiative in the Netherlands dedicated to building an integrated infrastructure for health and life-sciences data.

They are based on initial interpretations and should be used with caution. All entries are marked as drafts and will be further refined and validated in collaboration with stakeholders.</p> What is the goal of Health-RI\u2019s semantic interoperability initiative? <p>To enable meaningful data integration across health and life sciences institutions by aligning data semantically, not just structurally. This is achieved through the development and adoption of a common reference model that captures domain meaning explicitly.</p> What exactly are we trying to achieve with semantic interoperability? <p>We aim to align external and internal ontologies to a shared reference model, ensuring that semantic definitions are preserved across conceptual and computational layers. This is achieved through structured mappings (e.g., <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>) from third-party concepts to Health-RI\u2019s reference ontology (OntoUML) and its computational counterpart (gUFO).</p> Why is semantic interoperability important in healthcare and life sciences? <p>Because it ensures that data from diverse sources is interpreted consistently, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and improving reusability, reproducibility, and trust. It supports FAIR data practices and accelerates data-driven innovation.</p> What problem is this initiative addressing? <p>It addresses the issue of inconsistent data semantics across institutions, which leads to errors, false agreement, and limited reuse. Many systems use similar terms but with different meanings, or different terms for the same concept.</p> Is there a standardized way to define common reference models? Are we using standardized methods, languages, or tools? <p>There is currently no global standard for defining and implementing semantic reference models. However, the approach adopted by this initiative\u2014based on ontology-driven conceptual modeling and explicit ontological commitments\u2014is recognized in the literature as the only viable path to achieve real semantic interoperability (see Guizzardi (2020)).</p> <p>We apply well-established methods and languages that have been successfully used in a variety of domains and are widely recognized for their effectiveness (see Guizzardi et al. (2022)). These include:</p> <ul> <li>OntoUML for conceptual modeling</li> <li>OWL and RDF for computational representation and publishing</li> <li>SSSOM Mappings for declaring resources semantics</li> <li>Persistent identifiers, alignment with FAIR principles</li> </ul> <p>Other approaches may offer faster implementation or simpler integration but often fail to ensure semantic consistency over time. By contrast, our approach prioritizes long-term semantic precision and interoperability.</p> What does success look like for this project? <p>Success means having a robust reference model (OntoUML) and executable OWL artifacts (gUFO) in place, with external ontologies semantically aligned through precise mappings. It also includes supporting community contributions, replacing approximate mappings (e.g., <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>) with exact ones where possible, and continuously refining the model to bridge semantic gaps.</p> Who will benefit from or use the developed solutions? <p>Researchers, clinicians, developers, and data stewards who need to align datasets from different systems and institutions while preserving domain meaning.</p> Are there any external collaborators or partner organizations? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What is the current situation regarding data interoperability in the Netherlands? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> How do current systems or processes work without semantic alignment? <p>Without semantic alignment, systems may use the same term for different concepts or different terms for the same concept, causing ambiguity and inconsistency.</p> What are some examples of current successes or progress? <p>The development of the OntoUML conceptual model, its implementation as the gUFO OWL ontology, and the strategy for semantically aligning third-party ontologies using Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary properties are all concrete milestones achieved. Figures and examples in the documentation illustrate successful alignment strategies already in use.</p> What challenges are currently being faced? <p>One challenge is when no exact match exists between external concepts and the reference ontology. This requires approximate mappings and motivates the need to expand the Health-RI ontology to bridge gaps. Another challenge is managing transitivity and ambiguity in mappings (e.g., limiting to a single <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> per concept).</p> What risks and limitations should be considered? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What assumptions are being made during development? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What changes are expected in the future? <p>Future work includes refining the ontology by introducing intermediate concepts to replace approximate mappings with exact ones, enhancing semantic precision and reasoning capabilities.</p> How might the future process or system improve data use across institutions? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What changes will users experience? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What is the common reference model and why is it needed? <p>It\u2019s a conceptual model created using OntoUML to serve as a semantic anchor for all participating data schemas. Instead of replacing local schemas, it provides a shared foundation for mapping and aligning meaning.</p> <p>OntoUML defines the domain-level semantics, while gUFO implements those concepts in OWL. This layered architecture ensures that semantic meaning is preserved from human-level models to machine-readable artifacts.</p> How does this initiative relate to the FAIR principles? <p>It supports the 'I' in FAIR\u2014Interoperability\u2014by grounding vocabularies and schemas in shared ontologies and ontological commitments (see FAIR &amp; semantic interoperability).</p> What are the main components of the approach? <ul> <li>OntoUML conceptual modeling</li> <li>gUFO OWL-based computational ontologies</li> <li>Schema-to-ontology mappings using tools like SSSOM</li> </ul> Why do we need the semantic interoperability initiative if standards like HL7, OMOP, or DCAT-AP already exist? Isn\u2019t this duplicating existing efforts? <p>This initiative complements existing standards like HL7, OMOP, and DCAT by focusing on semantic precision, ontological clarity, and interoperability at the conceptual level. While HL7 and OMOP define syntactic and structural specifications for health data, this initiative addresses foundational semantics to align and reason over data models meaningfully. It:</p> <ul> <li>Provides foundational ontological grounding that is missing in most standards.</li> <li>Enables alignment across heterogeneous schemas and institutions through a shared conceptual backbone.</li> <li>Supports model-driven engineering (MDE) practices to enable consistent transformations and mappings.</li> </ul> What is the relationship between this initiative and existing health data standards such as OMOP, HL7, or DCAT-AP? <p>This initiative does not aim to create a new standard. Instead, it recognizes that existing standards such as OMOP, HL7, and DCAT-AP each serve different purposes and contain distinct types of content\u2014ranging from data exchange formats to terminologies and domain-specific data models.</p> <p>The goal is to harmonize the underlying concepts from these standards, as well as other models and artifacts, by aligning them with a shared semantic reference ontology. This ontology provides a common conceptual foundation that enables consistent interpretation and integration of diverse representations. The reference ontology acts as a semantic anchor, supporting interoperability across heterogeneous data sources, standards, and systems.</p> Why did Health-RI decide to build a new ontology instead of reusing existing ones from the biomedical and life sciences domains (like those in OBO Foundry)? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> Does the Health-RI initiative reuse any existing biomedical or life sciences ontologies? Are external ontologies integrated or referenced within the Health-RI ontology? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> Given that many life sciences ontologies adopt the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), what motivated the use of UFO rather than BFO as the foundation for this initiative\u2019s ontology? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#modeling-approach-ontouml-and-gufo","title":"Modeling Approach: OntoUML and gUFO","text":"<p>Questions about the internal modeling framework, layers, and implementation choices.</p> <p>Further reading:</p> <ul> <li>OntoUML overview</li> <li>gUFO details</li> </ul> What are OntoUML and gUFO, and why are they used? <p>OntoUML is a conceptual modeling language grounded in the foundational ontology named Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). gUFO is its OWL counterpart, enabling computational use. Together, they ensure semantic precision and machine-actionable models.</p> <p>OntoUML operates at MDA's CIM layer to capture conceptual semantics, while gUFO provides a platform-independent OWL implementation at the PIM layer. This ensures a traceable and interoperable flow from conceptualization to deployment.</p> OntoUML and gUFO seem very complex. Isn\u2019t that a barrier to adoption? <p>This is a common concern. Foundational ontologies like UFO are indeed complex\u2014because they aim to capture real-world meaning with a high level of precision and avoid ambiguity across domains. Some complexity is simply inherent to the task: when we model the real-life elements, especially across institutions or sectors, we cannot always rely on overly simplistic representations.</p> <p>That said, this initiative does not require users to engage directly with UFO. Instead, we rely on OntoUML and gUFO to make that foundational theory accessible in practice. OntoUML provides intuitive modeling constructs grounded in UFO, while gUFO offers a lightweight OWL implementation suitable for real-world applications.</p> <p>This layered approach lets modelers benefit from UFO\u2019s expressive power without being overwhelmed by its formal depth. The complexity is managed by the modeling framework and supported by tools like Visual Paradigm and the OntoUML plugin. In fact, these languages have already been applied successfully in domains like public health, law, and digital humanities\u2014demonstrating that the approach is both practical and scalable.</p> How is the OntoUML model converted to OWL? <p>The OntoUML model is exported to OWL using the gUFO specification via plugin tooling. The resulting ontology retains the original semantics in a format suitable for Semantic Web technologies.</p> What is the difference between OntoUML and gUFO? <p>OntoUML is a conceptual modeling language for humans; gUFO is its OWL-based computational counterpart used in Semantic Web technologies.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#mapping-and-alignment-strategy","title":"Mapping and Alignment Strategy","text":"<p>Questions about how external concepts are aligned to the Health-RI reference model using dedicated mapping properties from the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary.</p> <p>Further reading:</p> <ul> <li>Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary</li> <li>Mapping strategy guide</li> <li>How to contribute concepts/mappings</li> </ul> How are mappings from local schemas to the reference model created? <p>If schemas are OWL/RDF-based, mappings can be embedded directly using standard RDF properties. Otherwise, external mappings are created using SSSOM.</p> <p>Mappings follow the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary and can be asserted using:</p> <ul> <li><code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> for perfect semantic alignment (only one allowed),</li> <li><code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code> or <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code> when the match is approximate.</li> </ul> <p>These mappings support semantic alignment without requiring modification to the original schema and are managed either by Health-RI (non-invasively in SSSOM) or by partners (embedded in their own RDF models).</p> What is <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>, and how is it different from <code>owl:equivalentClass</code> or <code>skos:exactMatch</code>? <p><code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> (equivalent to <code>semiotics:expresses</code>) is used to state that an external concept carries the same intended meaning as a concept in the Health-RI reference model. It expresses a strong semantic alignment in terms of shared meaning, but it does not imply logical equivalence.</p> <ul> <li>Unlike <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, it does not entail formal logical equivalence and therefore avoids unintended reasoning consequences when integrating ontologies with different logical foundations.</li> <li>Unlike <code>skos:exactMatch</code>, which is often used for linking concepts across vocabularies in a looser, less formally grounded way, <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> is tied to an explicit semantic grounding in a reference ontology. This makes it more precise for interoperability scenarios where meaning\u2014not logical entailment\u2014is the key requirement.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> is intended for strong semantic alignment without the risks of logical overcommitment (<code>owl:equivalentClass</code>) or the potential ambiguity of generic lexical alignment (<code>skos:exactMatch</code>).</p> Why is there a rule that only one <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> is allowed per concept? <p>To avoid semantic ambiguity. Allowing multiple <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> assertions for the same concept would imply conflicting definitions and hinder consistent interpretation. Each external concept must match only one Health-RI concept with perfect equivalence.</p> What should I do if no exact match exists between my concept and the Health-RI ontology? <p>If your concept is broader or narrower than any existing reference concept, use <code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code> or <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code> accordingly. These mappings allow approximate alignment. You are also encouraged to contact the Health-RI team to propose additions to the reference model to enable more precise mappings in the future.</p> Can new concepts be added to the Health-RI ontology to improve mapping precision? <p>Yes. When <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> cannot be used due to missing concepts, we encourage you to contact the Health-RI modeling team.</p> <p>If justified, new intermediate concepts may be added to the reference ontology. This helps replace approximate mappings (<code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code>, <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code>) with exact ones and ensures better semantic precision for reasoning, integration, and long-term alignment. Requests are welcome and reviewed by the Health-RI modeling team; if accepted, new concepts may be added to enable stronger future mappings.</p> Who creates and maintains the semantic mappings to the Health-RI ontology? <p>Mappings can be created and maintained by:</p> <ul> <li>The Health-RI team, which curates non-invasive mappings using the SSSOM format, for public or external ontologies.

The most recent release is always accessible via: https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</p> How does versioning work for the ontology (X.Y.Z)? <p>Format: <code>X.Y.Z</code> with strict priority X &gt; Y &gt; Z \u2014 only one component increments per release; lower components reset.</p> <p>Meanings: - X \u2014 package index: add/remove a package \u2192 X++; then <code>Y = 0</code>, <code>Z = 0</code>. - Y \u2014 stage/semantic: any stage change (<code>int \u2194 irv \u2194 erv \u2194 pub</code>) or semantic modeling change \u2192 Y++; then <code>Z = 0</code>. - Z \u2014 non-semantic: labels/typos, diagram/layout, links/docs \u2192 Z++.</p> <p>Rules: No skipping numbers; exactly one single-step bump per release. Scope: Applies to the ontology; the mapping set and mapping vocabulary are versioned separately.</p> What does the 'latest' folder contain and how is it maintained? <p>The <code>ontologies/latest/</code> folder and the ontology's PID always resolves to the most recent available release. They provide stable access to the most recent files without needing to specify a version number. Each new release automatically updates the <code>latest/</code> folder and the file related to the ontology's PID to target the latest content.</p> How do I cite or refer to the Health-RI initiative and its artifacts? <p>You can use the following Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) to cite the initiative and its semantic artifacts:</p> <ul> <li>Initiative-wide identifier: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability</code></li> <li>Health-RI Ontology: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</code></li> <li>Health-RI SSOM Mapping Set: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings</code></li> <li>Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary</code></li> </ul> <p>These PIDs are stable, dereferenceable, and aligned with FAIR principles. They are suitable for use in citations, publications, and metadata records.</p> What types of files are published with each ontology version? <p>Each ontology version includes the following artifacts:</p> <ul> <li><code>.vpp</code>: OntoUML conceptual model (Visual Paradigm project)</li> <li><code>.json</code>: OntoUML export compliant with the OntoUML Schema</li> <li><code>.ttl</code>: OWL ontology (based on gUFO) \u2014 only for syntactically valid models</li> <li><code>.md</code>: Human-readable documentation (Markdown)</li> <li><code>.html</code>: Human-readable specification (HTML)</li> <li><code>.png</code>: Diagram images (only in the <code>latest/</code> folder)</li> </ul> <p>These are published under both <code>ontologies/latest/</code> (most recent version) and <code>ontologies/versioned/</code> (versioned archive).</p> Where can I find the exported images of the ontology diagrams? <p>Exported PNG images of all OntoUML diagrams are available in the <code>ontologies/latest/images/</code> folder. These images are always generated from the latest <code>.vpp</code> file and are not maintained for previous versions.</p> Why is there sometimes no OWL (.ttl) file available for a version? <p>The <code>.ttl</code> file (gUFO-compliant OWL ontology) is only generated when the OntoUML model is syntactically valid. Incomplete or draft versions may not include a <code>.ttl</code> file until model consistency is ensured.</p> Can the latest version of the OWL (.ttl) file correspond to a different version than the latest version of the OntoUML (.json/.vpp) model? <p>Yes. The <code>.ttl</code> versioning is managed independently and may lag behind the <code>.vpp</code> or <code>.json</code> files. The OWL file includes a <code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> triple that explicitly links it to the OntoUML version it was derived from.</p> How can I access a specific version of the Health-RI ontology? <p>Use the versioned PID format: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/vX.Y.Z/{format}</code></p> <p>Replace <code>X.Y.Z</code> with the version number (e.g., <code>v0.6.0</code>) and <code>{format}</code> with one of:</p> <ul> <li><code>ttl</code>: OWL ontology in Turtle format</li> <li><code>vpp</code>: OntoUML model in Visual Paradigm format</li> <li><code>json</code>: OntoUML model in JSON format</li> <li><code>specification</code>: Human-readable specification (HTML)</li> <li><code>documentation</code>: Human-readable documentation (Markdown)</li> </ul> <p>Examples: - <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/ttl</code> \u2014 Ontology in Turtle for version 0.6.0 - <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/specification</code> \u2014 HTML specification for version 0.6.0</p> What\u2019s the difference between the latest and versioned ontology URIs? <ul> <li>The latest URI (<code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</code>) always points to the most recent stable release. Its content may change over time as new versions are published.</li> <li>A versioned URI (e.g., <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v2.0.0</code>) points to a specific, immutable release. Its content will never change, ensuring long-term consistency.</li> </ul> <p>Use the versioned URI when immutability is essential \u2014 for example, in scientific publications, formal mappings, or regulatory documentation. This guarantees that your references always point to the same version of the ontology.</p> <p>Use the latest URI when you want to stay aligned with the most up-to-date ontology version and future improvements.</p> What is the publishing strategy for ontology releases? <p>What we publish (per release): - A tagged GitHub Release with packaged artifacts (Technical Report PDF, exported figures) and detailed notes. - An archived snapshot on Zenodo with a minted DOI (referenced from the Release notes). - Artifacts exposed under w3id PIDs and repository folders:     - Latest: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</code> and <code>ontologies/latest/</code> (most recent release).     - Versioned: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/vX.Y.Z/...</code> and <code>ontologies/versioned/</code> (immutable per release). - Catalog and discoverability records: OntoUML/UFO Catalog entry/update; Technical Report on ResearchGate; announcements on LinkedIn.</p> <p>Where to get the files: - GitHub Release page (exact packaged artifacts and notes). - Zenodo record (DOI) for a preserved, citable snapshot. - w3id PIDs and repository folders for \u201clatest\u201d and \u201cversioned\u201d access; images (<code>.png</code>) live under <code>ontologies/latest/</code>.</p> How are the OntoUML and gUFO ontologies and the produced semantic mappings maintained over time? <p>Ontologies and semantic mappings are maintained in version-controlled repositories and released through a structured publishing pipeline. Each release is assigned a permanent, citable URL, with both a Persistent Identifier (PI). Ontologies are published in multiple formats (e.g., RDF/Turtle, JSON) and validated prior to release. This process ensures transparency, long-term accessibility, and semantic stability across versions.</p> Who is responsible for maintaining the ontology and its associated mappings? <p>The Health-RI team is responsible for maintaining the core ontologies and mappings produced within the initiative. This work is carried out in close collaboration with external partners who contribute ideas, suggestions, and mappings. Contributions are reviewed and integrated through a structured, version-controlled process.</p> How will the new solutions be maintained and supported? <p>After a package reaches <code>pub</code>, we run the Publication Stage Operations Checklist while remaining in <code>pub</code>:</p> <ul> <li>Release and preservation: publish a GitHub Release (tag, notes) including the package report (PDF) and figures; trigger Zenodo and record the DOI.</li> <li>Catalog and discoverability: update the OntoUML/UFO Catalog; upload the report to ResearchGate; announce publication and follow-ups (e.g., DOI/catalog) on LinkedIn.</li> <li>Academic publication (optional): consider a peer-reviewed venue; when accepted, add the formal citation and publisher DOI to the docs and Release.</li> </ul> <p>Ongoing support and feedback: GitHub Issues remain open as a standing channel; substantive issues can lead to a stage reversion for corrective work. Scope: This operational checklist is specific to the ontology.</p> What happens right after a package is published (<code>pub</code>)? <p>While remaining in <code>pub</code>, we: - Publish a GitHub Release (tag, notes, packaged artifacts) and mint a Zenodo DOI. - Update the OntoUML/UFO Catalog and upload the Technical Report to ResearchGate. - Post announcements and follow-ups (e.g., DOI/catalog) on LinkedIn. Feedback continues via GitHub Issues; substantive issues may trigger a reversion to <code>int</code>.</p> How will the ontology be tested and accepted? <p>Acceptance is tied to passing the stage gate checklists:</p> <ul> <li><code>int \u2192 irv</code> gate (author self-check + modeling/diagram/metadata readiness).   Entry into <code>irv</code> happens only after all Internal Stage Gate items pass.</li> <li><code>irv \u2192 erv</code> gate (independent internal review).   Reviewers execute the Internal Review Stage Gate; evidence is recorded in the review issue.</li> <li><code>erv \u2192 pub</code> outcome (independent external review).   When the package passes external review, the modeler records <code>&lt;erv \u2192 pub&gt;</code>; then the Publication Stage Operations Checklist is executed while remaining in <code>pub</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Timelines: internal and external reviews are planned as sprint activities; the target is one sprint, optionally extended to two depending on scope and availability. Note: Substantive defects or scope changes at any stage can revert the package to <code>int</code> for rework; advancement then follows the same gates again.</p> Where can I find an overview of all persistent identifiers provided by the initiative? <p>The initiative maintains a consolidated table of all PIDs, covering the ontology, mapping set, and mapping vocabulary. This table describes the behavior of each PID (e.g., redirects, format-specific access) and provides examples.</p>"},{"location":"method/","title":"The Health-RI Method","text":"<p>The Health-RI Method section provides a structured overview of how semantic interoperability is achieved and maintained within the Health-RI initiative.

What is needed is semantic interoperability\u2014a shared understanding of the meaning behind the data being exchanged.</p> <p>As illustrated in the figure above, each node maintains its own data schema and data repository.

External ontologies aligned through the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary (<code>hriv</code>) can then be interpreted as sharing the same underlying conceptualization defined by OntoUML. This ensures that both meaning and representation remain consistent across models and ontologies.</p> <p>In this Figure:</p> <ul> <li>Real-world referents (globe and people, top-right): indicate the actual entities in the domain (e.g., human beings) that the conceptualization is about. These are the things to which all conceptualizations ultimately refer.</li> <li>Shared Conceptualization (top, cloud icon): represents the underlying domain meaning (e.g., Person) that is shared across different artifacts. This is the abstract conceptualization formalized in OntoUML, implemented computationally in gUFO, and explicitly anchored when an external ontology concept is mapped through the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary.</li> <li>OntoUML class (<code>&lt;&lt;kind&gt;&gt; Person</code>, left): formalizes this conceptualization at the CIM layer, providing precise ontological grounding (in UFO) for what it means to be a Person. When we create a class <code>&lt;&lt;kind&gt;&gt; Person</code> in OntoUML, we are doing more than drawing a box labeled \"Person.\" We are encoding the meaning of Person in a structured way that the modeling language understands. In this sense, the OntoUML concept plays the role of a meaningful representation: it carries intentional meaning (e.g., the notion of a person as an entity with essential properties, understood via UFO\u2019s category of Kind) and it is also an explicit element in a model.</li> <li>gUFO implementation (<code>hrio:Person</code>, bottom): expresses the same meaning in computational terms at the PIM layer, making it machine-readable and interoperable. gUFO classes always inherit their semantics from the OntoUML concepts they implement.</li> <li>External ontology concept (<code>ont:Human</code>, right): denotes how a third-party ontology may define a similar concept. When mapped via the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary (e.g., <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>), such an external concept is explicitly anchored to the gUFO representation and, by transitivity, to the original OntoUML conceptualization.</li> </ul> <p>Taken together, the diagram shows that (i) the Health-RI OntoUML model provides the authoritative conceptual meaning, (ii) the gUFO implementation operationalizes this meaning computationally, and (iii) external mappings assert that third-party ontologies share this meaning.</p> <p>This guarantees that when a partner ontology concept is mapped to the Health-RI ontology using <code>hriv</code>, it is not only aligned with the gUFO class but is also understood to embody the same conceptualization originally defined in OntoUML. In this way, interoperability extends beyond structural matching to the preservation of intended meaning.</p> <p>OntoUML and OWL are complementary in that they operate at different knowledge representation levels. OntoUML is a conceptual modeling language\u2014closer to human cognition and domain semantics\u2014whereas OWL is a computational ontology language\u2014suited for machine tractability and reasoning. Designing at the conceptual level first ensures the meaning is captured correctly before committing to OWL\u2019s computational restrictions.</p> <p>Theories of formal semantics tell us that an OWL class gets its meaning from two sources: the formal semantics of the logic (which treats Person as a set of individuals with certain properties) and the intended interpretation by the modeler (the conceptualization of Person). By explicitly maintaining the link (<code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>) between <code>ont:Human</code> and <code>hrio:Person</code> (which is anchored in the conceptualization), we ensure that the formal artifact is interpreted correctly. By grounding both the OntoUML and OWL representations in the same meaning, we mitigate the risk of the OWL ontology drifting from the original intent. This establishes a traceability of semantics\u2014from the real-world domain, to the conceptual model, to the formal ontology\u2014which is a characteristic of rigorous ontology engineering.

A Phase is relationally independent (it does not require an external relator to be instantiated) but is temporary with respect to the instance\u2019s existence.

All of those subtypes are physical objects sharing common essential properties (e.g., having mass and spatial extension), so those common properties are captured in the Category PhysicalObject.

An individual entity (say, a particular dog) instantiates AdultOrganism during the time it\u2019s an adult, and a particular person instantiates AdultOrganism during their adult life stage. This modeling assures that AdultOrganism is not tied to one Kind\u2019s identity principle, and an instance ceases to instantiate the PhaseMixin when it\u2019s no longer in that phase (e.g., if it were possible to revert, or simply that it only instantiates after a certain age).</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#mixin","title":"Mixin","text":"<p>Definition: A Mixin is a non-sortal class (no single identity principle of its own) that aggregates properties which are essential to some of its instances but accidental to others \u2013 this means a Mixin is semi-rigid.

In an OntoUML model, Seatable as a Mixin would have chairs and stools as essential instances (if something is a Chair Kind, it must also be Seatable), while also potentially classifying other things that happen to be used as seats (accidentally seatable).

If we model Weight as a Quality, an individual object (say, a specific parcel) might have an instance of Weight (a mode) that connects it to a value (e.g., 5 kilograms) in the weight dimension. Another example is Color as a Quality: an apple has a particular color trope (its specific shade of red) that links the apple to a position in the color space. In OntoUML, we might represent Color as a Quality class; an instance \u201cthis apple\u2019s color\u201d is a quality dependent on that apple and is associated with a value (like an RGB value or a spot on the spectrum).

For instance, one might have an Accident class stereotyped \u00abevent\u00bb to represent accident occurrences. An individual accident (say, a specific car crash on January 1, 2025) is an instance of Accident.

In OntoUML, a material relation (stereotyped \u00abmaterial\u00bb) indicates that the relationship cannot hold unless a certain relator instance exists connecting the participants [1]. Material relations are typically contingent (not necessarily always true for the same pair of individuals over time) and are derivable: there is usually a corresponding Relator class and mediation associations that formally ground the material relation.</p> <p>Example: \u201cis married to\u201d between two Person instances is a Material relation \u2013 it holds due to the existence of a Marriage relator connecting those persons.

Similarly, \u201cworks for\u201d (between a Person and a Company) is material, typically founded on an EmploymentContract or employment relator. The OntoUML model would include an explicit relator class Employment with mediations to Person and Company, and the material relation works for can be derived via that relator. In essence, material relations in the diagram show the surface-level connection (e.g., Person \u2013works for\u2192 Company) while a relator (e.g., an instance of Employment) and mediation links provide the ontological justification for why that relation holds.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#mediation","title":"Mediation","text":"<p>Definition: Mediation is a fundamental existential dependence relationship that connects a relator to the entities it depends on (its participants). An association stereotyped \u00abmediation\u00bb links a relator type with a sortal type that the relator \u201cmediates\u201d or connects. Mediation signifies that an instance of the relator cannot exist unless it is mediating (linked to) an instance of the other type, and typically the relator is dependent on at least two such entities (hence there will be at least two mediation relations for a relator). In OntoUML, each relator must mediate at least two distinct individuals. Mediation is a directed relation: it goes from the relator to the mediated type(s), indicating the relator\u2019s dependency on its participants [7].</p> <p>Example: In a marriage scenario, a class Marriage (stereotyped \u00abrelator\u00bb) will have two mediation relations: one mediating Marriage to Person (for the spouse role on one side) and another mediating Marriage to Person (for the spouse on the other side). Each Marriage instance must be connected via these mediations to two person instances \u2013 it cannot exist in isolation. Another example: an Enrollment relator between a Student and a School would be modeled with a mediation from Enrollment to Student and another from Enrollment to School. The presence of an Enrollment instance (say, a specific enrollment record) is contingent on a particular student and a particular school existing. Mediation explicitly captures that dependence in the model \u2013 e.g., \u201cEnrollment (John \u2190enrollment\u2192 University X)\u201d, where the mediations connect the enrollment relator to John and to University X.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#characterization","title":"Characterization","text":"<p>Definition: Characterization is a relationship that links an individual (the bearer) with an intrinsic dependent property (the feature that characterizes it).

The feature is an existentially dependent moment of the bearer \u2013 it cannot exist without the bearer, and it represents some intrinsic aspect of that bearer. The characterization relation signifies that every instance of the bearer type is associated with (or \u201cexemplifies\u201d) an instance of the feature type in question. (In formal terms, if a characterization link exists, the feature is said to inhere in the bearer.) [7]</p> <p>Example: If we model Weight as a Quality and Person as a Kind, a characterization relation might link Weight to Person (a person has a weight). An instance of Weight (say, John\u2019s weight of 70 kg) characterizes the individual John. John cannot have that particular weight instance without John existing, and that weight depends on John. As another example, consider a mode class Belief and an object class Agent; a characterization relation Agent has Belief means each belief instance exists in (characterizes) some agent. If Mary holds a particular belief (instance of Belief), that belief characterization link ties it to Mary as its bearer. Characterization relations are by nature directed from the mode/quality to the bearer (the mode \u201ccharacterizes\u201d the bearer) and typically have a cardinality of 1 at the bearer end (each mode instance is tied to exactly one bearer).</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#derivation","title":"Derivation","text":"<p>Definition: Derivation is a meta-relationship in OntoUML that connects a material relation to the relator that lies at its foundation. An association stereotyped \u00abderivation\u00bb links a relator class to a material association, indicating that the material relationship can be logically derived from the existence of the relator and its mediation relations [2]. In effect, the derivation relationship specifies that if a certain relator instance is present connecting two entities, then a corresponding material relation instance holds between those entities (and vice-versa, the material relation\u2019s presence implies a relator). This construct helps maintain consistency: cardinality constraints on the material relation are determined by the combination of mediations and the relator\u2019s existence.</p> <p>Example: In a model with Marriage as a relator and a material relation \u201cis married to\u201d between Person and Person, we would use a \u00abderivation\u00bb to tie the is married to association to the Marriage class. This indicates that \u201cPerson A is married to Person B\u201d is true if and only if there exists a Marriage instance connecting A and B. The derivation association often is shown as a dashed line from the relator to the material relation. Another example: a relator EmploymentContract might derive a material relation \u201cworks for\u201d (Person \u2013works for\u2192 Company). The derivation relationship formally states that the works for link between a given person and company exists because an EmploymentContract relator instance connects them, and if that contract is terminated (relator ceases to exist), the works for relation no longer holds.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#componentof","title":"ComponentOf","text":"<p>Definition: ComponentOf is a part-whole relationship stereotype that represents a functional composition between two objects. An association \u00abcomponentOf\u00bb indicates that the source is a part (component) of the target, and this part contributes in a specific way to the functionality of the whole. Both the whole and the part in a ComponentOf relation are typically functional complexes (Kinds or Subkinds that are complex objects). The relation is usually rigid for the part (the part must be part of some whole of the specified type while it exists) and often carries the inference that if the whole ceases to exist, the part\u2019s specific role or existence as that component ceases as well (depending on cardinalities and modality) [7].</p> <p>Example: A Engine is componentOf a Car. In an OntoUML model, if we have classes Car and Engine (both Kinds, say), a \u00abcomponentOf\u00bb relation from Engine (source) to Car (target) means an engine is a part of a car. The engine plays a functional role (providing power) in the context of the car. If we remove the engine from the car, it no longer functions as a \u201ccar engine\u201d (it might be just a spare part unless placed in another car). Other examples: Heart componentOf HumanBody, Wheel componentOf Bicycle.

It carries the semantics that the members together form the collective whole, and often the collective\u2019s identity is independent of any particular member (extensional identity principle). Cardinality constraints usually allow multiple members in the collective and typically a member belongs to at most one such collective of the same type at a time (depending on the nature of the group) [1].</p> <p>Example: Person memberOf Team: an OntoUML model might have a class Team stereotyped \u00abcollective\u00bb and class Person (a Kind), with a \u00abmemberOf\u00bb association from Person to Team. This means persons are members of teams. For instance, Alice is a member of The Design Team. If Alice leaves the team, she is no longer connected by that memberOf relation, but the team may still continue (possibly with different members). Another example: a Soldier memberOf Platoon or Tree memberOf Forest (if Forest is treated as a collective of trees). In each case, the collection\u2019s identity (the team, platoon, or forest) isn\u2019t tied to any single member \u2013 members can come or go.

This relation is typically transitive and is used to model hierarchical groupings [1].</p> <p>Example: A Squad is a sub-collection of a Battalion. If we model a military unit hierarchy, Battalion (whole) and Squad (part) could both be Collectives (each comprised of soldiers), with a \u00absubCollectionOf\u00bb relation linking Squad to Battalion. This indicates each squad is part of some battalion.

An association \u00abparticipation\u00bb always relates a class stereotyped \u00abevent\u00bb to a class representing some endurant type. The existence of a participation link means that the endurant was involved in or present during the event [5].

Another example: if Company is a Kind and FoundingEvent is an event class, a \u00abcreation\u00bb link can indicate that a company comes into existence as a result of a founding event. In the model, we might say StartupInc (Company) is connected to StartupIncFoundingEvent 2021 via a creation association \u2013 interpreting that the company was established in that event.

This capability is vital across various sectors, including healthcare, public administration, and the Internet of Things (IoT), facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#what-is-semantic-interoperability","title":"What is Semantic Interoperability?","text":"<p>Semantic interoperability refers to the ability of different computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Unlike syntactic interoperability, which focuses on the format of data exchange, semantic interoperability ensures that the meaning of the data is preserved and understood consistently across different systems. This is achieved by linking data elements to a common vocabulary or ontology, allowing machines to interpret and process information accurately without human intervention [1][2].</p> <p>A critical challenge that semantic interoperability aims to address is the \"false agreement\" problem, as defined by Nicola Guarino. This problem arises when different agents (e.g., systems or people) use the same term but mean different things, or when they use different terms but mean the same thing. Guarino explains that many current representation languages are ontologically neutral, allowing knowledge engineers to use identical formal structures to represent fundamentally distinct concepts. This neutrality often leads to false agreements\u2014apparent consensus at the syntactic or logical level that masks genuine semantic divergence.</p> <p>To prevent this, semantic interoperability frameworks must explicitly represent ontological commitments, ensuring that shared terms reflect shared understanding [3]. Building on this, Guizzardi adds that interoperability succeeds only when these commitments are not only stated, but also harmonized across systems [11]. Without this alignment, different agents may construct models that appear compatible but actually rely on divergent conceptualizations. As both Guarino and Guizzardi highlight, even when systems use the same vocabulary, they can still misunderstand each other if their ontologies reflect different views of the world. Semantic interoperability must therefore go beyond vocabulary alignment to include agreement on the underlying conceptual structure [4].</p> <p>As Guizzardi explains, every information system necessarily reflects a particular view of reality, whether explicitly or not. That is, it commits to a conceptualization\u2014a theory about what exists and how things are related. Even when developers are unaware of it, their systems make assumptions about the nature of the entities they represent. These assumptions must be clarified and aligned if systems are to interoperate semantically [11].</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#why-is-semantic-interoperability-important","title":"Why is Semantic Interoperability Important?","text":"<p>The importance of semantic interoperability lies in its capacity to enable accurate and meaningful data exchange, which is crucial for decision-making, efficiency, and innovation. In healthcare, for instance, it allows for the seamless sharing of patient information across different electronic health record systems, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. In public services, it supports transparency and collaboration between governmental bodies [5][6]. This need for meaningful data exchange is reflected in the FAIR principles, which highlight Interoperability as one of the four essential pillars of data stewardship [12].</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#semantic-interoperability-and-the-i-of-fair","title":"Semantic Interoperability and the \u201cI\u201d of FAIR","text":"<p>The FAIR guiding principles identify Interoperability as a central pillar for maximizing the value of information artifacts [12]. According to Guizzardi, the \u201cI\u201d in FAIR must be understood not just as a technical property, but as a commitment to meaningful, semantically grounded data integration that supports human interoperation mediated by machines [11].</p> <p>The FAIR principles I1\u2013I3 specify that: 1. (meta)data should use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation; 2. (meta)data should rely on vocabularies that themselves follow FAIR principles; 3. (meta)data should include qualified references to other (meta)data.</p> <p>These requirements cannot be fulfilled by mere terminological resources alone. To ensure that systems interpret shared data consistently, vocabularies must be underpinned by ontologies\u2014explicit and formal representations of shared conceptualizations. Guizzardi emphasizes that vocabularies must be ontologically grounded in order to properly support semantic interoperability [11].</p> <p>To achieve this, two levels of support are needed: - Ontologies (in the plural) serve as \u201cmeaning contracts\u201d that clarify the domain-specific conceptualizations shared between systems; - Ontology (as a discipline) provides the formal methods and theories required to build these ontologies correctly and to clarify their commitments.</p> <p>This ontological grounding is essential to ensure that relations between data elements reflect not only their syntactic alignment, but also their real-world semantics, including identity, dependence, and other ontological distinctions.</p> <p>Guizzardi argues that formal ontologies\u2014such as the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)\u2014play a key role in satisfying the interoperability requirements of FAIR. Ontology-driven representation languages like OntoUML allow modelers to specify their conceptualizations in a way that is formally constrained, semantically rich, and verifiable. This ontological precision is crucial to prevent the false agreement problem, in which systems appear interoperable at the surface level but interpret the same data differently beneath it.</p> <p>Ultimately, the \u201cI\u201d of FAIR demands more than connectivity and shared syntax.
