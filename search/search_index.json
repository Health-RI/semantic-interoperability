This is achieved through the development and adoption of a common reference model that captures domain meaning explicitly.</p> What exactly are we trying to achieve with semantic interoperability? <p>We aim to align external and internal ontologies to a shared reference model, ensuring that semantic definitions are preserved across conceptual and computational layers. This is achieved through structured meaning mappings (e.g., <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>) from third-party concepts to the Health-RI Ontology (HRIO), specified in OntoUML and implemented as a gUFO-based OWL ontology (HRIO gUFO/OWL).</p> Why is semantic interoperability important in healthcare and life sciences? <p>Because it ensures that data from diverse sources is interpreted consistently, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and improving reusability, reproducibility, and trust. It supports FAIR data practices and accelerates data-driven innovation.</p> What problem is this initiative addressing? <p>It addresses the issue of inconsistent data semantics across institutions, which leads to errors, false agreement, and limited reuse. Many systems use similar terms but with different meanings, or different terms for the same concept. Rather than assuming agreement based on labels, definitions, codes, or OWL axioms, the initiative requires that mapped concepts be traced back to a shared, well-defined conceptualization.</p> Is there a standardized way to define common reference models? Are we using standardized methods, languages, or tools? <p>There is currently no global standard for defining and implementing semantic reference models. However, the approach adopted by this initiative\u2014based on ontology-driven conceptual modeling and explicit ontological commitments\u2014is recognized in the literature as a viable path to achieve semantic interoperability (see Guizzardi (2020)).</p> <p>We apply well-established methods and languages that have been successfully used in a variety of domains and are widely recognized for their effectiveness (see Guizzardi et al. (2022)). These include:</p> <ul> <li>OntoUML for conceptual modeling (reference model)</li> <li>OWL and RDF for computational representation and publishing (gUFO-based OWL implementation)</li> <li>SSSOM mapping sets for sharing meaning mappings (when mappings are maintained as separate artifacts)</li> <li>Persistent identifiers, alignment with FAIR principles</li> </ul> <p>Other approaches may offer faster implementation or simpler integration but often fail to ensure semantic consistency over time. By contrast, our approach prioritizes long-term semantic precision and interoperability.</p> What does success look like for this project? <p>Success means having a robust reference model (HRIO OntoUML) and its executable OWL implementation (HRIO gUFO/OWL) in place, with external ontologies semantically aligned through precise meaning mappings. It also includes supporting community contributions, replacing broader/narrower meaning mappings (<code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code>, <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code>) with <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> where possible, and continuously refining the model to bridge semantic gaps.</p> Who will benefit from or use the developed solutions? <p>Researchers, clinicians, developers, and data stewards who need to align datasets from different systems and institutions while preserving domain meaning.</p> Are there any external collaborators or partner organizations? <p>Yes. The initiative's work is carried out with Health-RI's external collaborators, including Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) and Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC).</p> What is the current situation regarding data interoperability in the Netherlands? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> How do current systems or processes work without semantic alignment? <p>Without semantic alignment, systems may use the same term for different concepts or different terms for the same concept, causing ambiguity and inconsistency.</p> What are some examples of current successes or progress? <p>The development of the OntoUML conceptual model, its implementation as the gUFO OWL ontology, and the strategy for semantically aligning third-party ontologies using Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary properties are all concrete milestones achieved. Figures and examples in the documentation illustrate successful alignment strategies already in use.</p> What challenges are currently being faced? <p>One challenge is when no exact-meaning alignment is justified between an external concept and the reference ontology. This requires broader/narrower meaning mappings and motivates the need to expand the Health-RI ontology to bridge gaps over time.</p> <p>Another challenge is ensuring consistent interpretation across tooling. HRIV mappings can be aligned to SKOS mapping relations for interoperability and discovery, but SKOS-level entailments (e.g., transitivity of <code>skos:exactMatch</code>) must not be used to change the intended interpretation of an HRIV mapping. This makes curation rules and governance important for keeping mappings reliable as sources evolve.</p> What risks and limitations should be considered? <p>The current documentation illustrates intended benefits but does not yet present an empirical evaluation of mapping-effort reduction, error reduction, or user comprehension gains.</p> <p>Adoption may also increase initial effort in the short term, since new standards and local schemas still require curated meaning mappings. In addition, mappings must be maintained per source artifact and release, and reviewed when source or HRIO definitions evolve. The long-term success of the approach therefore depends on sustained community engagement and governance to curate and maintain mappings as artifacts evolve.</p> What assumptions are being made during development? <p>The approach relies on explicit semantic assumptions linking layers and artifacts. In particular:</p> <ul> <li>The HRIO gUFO/OWL ontology is treated as an implementation of the HRIO OntoUML reference model, preserving the same intended meanings across conceptual and computational layers.</li> <li>External artifacts are treated as indirectly representing HRIO meanings via their HRIV links to HRIO concepts; this \"indirect representation\" is derived from implementation and mapping assumptions rather than encoded as an OWL relation.</li> </ul> <p>In the OWL implementation, mapping assertions are expressed as object-property assertions between individuals denoting expressions and meanings (with OWL 2 DL punning when OWL class IRIs are used). As a result, HRIV mappings should not be interpreted as OWL class axioms.</p> What changes are expected in the future? <p>Future work includes refining the ontology by introducing intermediate concepts to replace approximate mappings with exact ones, enhancing semantic precision and reasoning capabilities.</p> How might the future process or system improve data use across institutions? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What changes will users experience? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> What is the common reference model and why is it needed? <p>It's a conceptual model created using OntoUML to serve as a semantic anchor for all participating data schemas. Instead of replacing local schemas, it provides a shared foundation for mapping and aligning meaning.</p> <p>OntoUML defines the domain-level semantics, while gUFO implements those concepts in OWL. This layered architecture ensures that semantic meaning is preserved from human-level models to machine-readable artifacts.</p> How does this initiative relate to the FAIR principles? <p>It supports the 'I' in FAIR\u2014Interoperability\u2014by grounding vocabularies and schemas in shared ontologies and ontological commitments (see FAIR &amp; semantic interoperability).</p> What are the main components of the approach? <ul> <li>OntoUML conceptual modeling</li> <li>gUFO OWL-based computational ontologies</li> <li>Schema-to-ontology mappings using tools like SSSOM</li> </ul> Why do we need the semantic interoperability initiative if standards like HL7, OMOP, or DCAT-AP already exist? Isn't this duplicating existing efforts? <p>This initiative complements existing standards like HL7, OMOP, and DCAT by focusing on semantic precision, ontological clarity, and interoperability at the conceptual level. While HL7 and OMOP define syntactic and structural specifications for health data, this initiative addresses foundational semantics to align and reason over data models meaningfully. It:</p> <ul> <li>Provides foundational ontological grounding that is missing in most standards.</li> <li>Enables alignment across heterogeneous schemas and institutions through a shared conceptual backbone.</li> <li>Supports model-driven engineering (MDE) practices to enable consistent transformations and mappings.</li> </ul> What is the relationship between this initiative and existing health data standards such as OMOP, HL7, or DCAT-AP? <p>This initiative does not aim to create a new standard. Instead, it recognizes that existing standards such as OMOP, HL7, and DCAT-AP each serve different purposes and contain distinct types of content\u2014ranging from data exchange formats to terminologies and domain-specific data models.</p> <p>The goal is to harmonize the underlying concepts from these standards, as well as other models and artifacts, by aligning them with a shared semantic reference ontology. This ontology provides a common conceptual foundation that enables consistent interpretation and integration of diverse representations. The reference ontology acts as a semantic anchor, supporting interoperability across heterogeneous data sources, standards, and systems.</p> Why did Health-RI decide to build a new ontology instead of reusing existing ones from the biomedical and life sciences domains (like those in OBO Foundry)? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> Does the Health-RI initiative reuse any existing biomedical or life sciences ontologies? Are external ontologies integrated or referenced within the Health-RI ontology? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p> Given that many life sciences ontologies adopt the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), what motivated the use of UFO rather than BFO as the foundation for this initiative's ontology? (TBD) <p>TBD.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#modeling-approach-ontouml-and-gufo","title":"Modeling Approach: OntoUML and gUFO","text":"<p>Questions about the internal modeling framework, layers, and implementation choices.</p> <p>Further reading:</p> <ul> <li>OntoUML overview</li> <li>gUFO details</li> </ul> What are OntoUML and gUFO, and why are they used? <p>OntoUML is a conceptual modeling language grounded in the foundational ontology named Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). gUFO is its OWL counterpart, enabling computational use. Together, they ensure semantic precision and machine-actionable models.</p> <p>OntoUML operates at MDA's CIM layer to capture conceptual semantics, while gUFO provides a platform-independent OWL implementation at the PIM layer. This ensures a traceable and interoperable flow from conceptualization to deployment.</p> OntoUML and gUFO seem very complex. Isn't that a barrier to adoption? <p>This is a common concern. Foundational ontologies like UFO are indeed complex\u2014because they aim to capture real-world meaning with a high level of precision and avoid ambiguity across domains. Some complexity is simply inherent to the task: when we model the real-life elements, especially across institutions or sectors, we cannot always rely on overly simplistic representations.</p> <p>That said, this initiative does not require users to engage directly with UFO. Instead, we rely on OntoUML and gUFO to make that foundational theory accessible in practice. OntoUML provides intuitive modeling constructs grounded in UFO, while gUFO offers a lightweight OWL implementation suitable for real-world applications.</p> <p>This layered approach lets modelers benefit from UFO's expressive power without being overwhelmed by its formal depth. The complexity is managed by the modeling framework and supported by tools like Visual Paradigm and the OntoUML plugin. In fact, these languages have already been applied successfully in domains like public health, law, and digital humanities\u2014demonstrating that the approach is both practical and scalable.</p> How is the OntoUML model converted to OWL? <p>The OntoUML model is exported to OWL using the gUFO specification via plugin tooling.

It expresses a strong meaning mapping, but it does not imply logical equivalence.</p> <ul> <li>Unlike <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, it does not entail formal logical equivalence and therefore avoids unintended reasoning consequences when integrating ontologies with different logical foundations.</li> <li>Unlike <code>skos:exactMatch</code>, which is often used for linking concepts across vocabularies in a looser, less formally grounded way, <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> is tied to an explicit semantic grounding in a reference ontology.</li> </ul> <p>In the OWL implementation, HRIV mapping assertions are not OWL class axioms: they are expressed as object-property assertions between individuals denoting expressions and meanings (with OWL 2 DL punning when class IRIs are used). Therefore, they do not imply <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, <code>owl:sameAs</code>, or <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> entailments between the mapped classes. For compatibility with SKOS tooling, corresponding SKOS mapping assertions can be derived, but the HRIV predicate remains the authoritative carrier of the intended meaning.</p> Do HRIV mappings imply OWL entailments between external classes (e.g., equivalence or subsumption)? <p>No. HRIV mappings are not OWL class axioms between external classes. They link external concepts to HRIO meanings (and, in OWL 2 DL implementations, rely on punning when class IRIs are used as individuals).</p> <p>Once external concepts are linked to HRIO meanings, their relationship can be assessed by inspecting (and querying/reasoning over) HRIO. Any derived cross-standard relationship should be interpreted as a mapping-level assessment grounded in HRIO, not as an OWL DL class-level entailment between the external classes.</p> How does HRIV relate to SKOS mapping relations? <p>HRIV mapping relations are aligned via <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code> to corresponding SKOS mapping relations so Health-RI mappings can participate in SKOS-based tooling and workflows.</p> <p>However, the HRIV predicates remain the authoritative carriers of the intended (definitional) semantics: any entailed SKOS mapping assertions should be treated as a derived \"SKOS view\" for interoperability and discovery, and SKOS-level entailments (e.g., transitivity of <code>skos:exactMatch</code>) must not be used to change the intended interpretation of an HRIV mapping.</p> Why is there a rule that only one <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> is allowed per concept? <p>To avoid semantic ambiguity during curation and downstream interpretation. Allowing multiple <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> assertions for the same external concept would make its intended meaning unclear (or potentially conflicting), which hinders consistent use in interoperability scenarios.</p> <p>Practically, this is best treated as a curation/validation policy for Health-RI mapping artifacts (rather than an OWL logical constraint): HRIV's use is designed around controlled, consistently interpretable mapping assertions.</p> How do I choose between <code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code> and <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code>? <p>Use <code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code> when your expression is broader in scope than the HRIO target (it includes the HRIO concept but is not limited to it). Use <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code> when your expression is narrower in scope than the HRIO target (it is limited to a subset of what the HRIO concept covers).</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Broader-than: \"Adult patient\" mapped to \"Pregnant adult patient\" (the expression covers more than the target).</li> <li>Narrower-than: \"Left femur fracture\" mapped to \"Femur fracture\" (the expression covers less than the target).</li> </ul> Is there a tool to help me draft mappings to HRIO? <p>Yes. Use the HRIO Mapping Assistant (GPT)</p> <p>It helps you map a domain concept to HRIO by proposing one HRIV predicate and a candidate HRIO target, plus a confidence estimate and supporting evidence snippets you can use in <code>mapping_justification</code>.</p> <p>Treat the output as a draft: you remain responsible for verifying the target meaning in HRIO and following the curation/review rules before contributing or publishing mappings.</p> What should I do if no exact match exists between my concept and the Health-RI ontology? <p>If your concept is broader or narrower than any existing reference concept, use <code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code> or <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code> accordingly. These mappings allow approximate alignment. You are also encouraged to contact the Health-RI team to propose additions to the reference model to enable more precise mappings in the future.</p> Can new concepts be added to the Health-RI ontology to improve mapping precision? <p>Yes. When <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code> cannot be used due to missing concepts, we encourage you to contact the Health-RI modeling team.</p> <p>If justified, new intermediate concepts may be added to the reference ontology. This helps replace approximate mappings (<code>hriv:hasBroaderMeaningThan</code>, <code>hriv:hasNarrowerMeaningThan</code>) with exact ones and ensures better semantic precision for reasoning, integration, and long-term alignment. Requests are welcome and reviewed by the Health-RI modeling team; if accepted, new concepts may be added to enable stronger future mappings.</p> Who creates and maintains the semantic mappings to the Health-RI ontology? <p>Mappings can be created and maintained by:</p> <ul> <li>The Health-RI team, which curates non-invasive mappings using the SSSOM format, for public or external ontologies. These mappings are published externally and do not alter the original third-party ontologies.</li> <li>External partners, who can embed mappings directly in their own ontology files using Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary properties (e.g., <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>), especially when they control the editorial process of the external artifact.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#sssom-mapping-set","title":"SSSOM Mapping Set","text":"Is the Health-RI SSSOM Mapping Set manually curated or automatically generated? <p>It is manually curated by the Health-RI mapping team with input from external collaborators.</p> Where can I download the SSSOM Mapping Set, and in which formats? <p>Use the stable URIs:</p> <ul> <li><code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings</code> \u2192 TTL</li> <li><code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings/ttl</code> \u2192 TTL</li> <li><code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings/tsv</code> \u2192 TSV.</li> </ul> How is the mapping set versioned? <p>The mapping set uses date-based versions (YYYY-MM-DD) tied to the publication date, with at most one release per day.</p> Can a published mapping be deleted?

The most recent release is always accessible via: https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</p> How does versioning work for the ontology (X.Y.Z)? <p>Format: <code>X.Y.Z</code> with strict priority X &gt; Y &gt; Z \u2014 only one component increments per release; lower components reset.</p> <p>Meanings:</p> <ul> <li>X \u2014 package index: add/remove a package \u2192 X++; then <code>Y = 0</code>, <code>Z = 0</code>.</li> <li>Y \u2014 stage/semantic: any stage change (<code>int \u2194 irv \u2194 erv \u2194 pub</code>) or semantic modeling change \u2192 Y++; then <code>Z = 0</code>.</li> <li>Z \u2014 non-semantic: labels/typos, diagram/layout, links/docs \u2192 Z++.</li> </ul> <p>Rules: No skipping numbers; exactly one single-step bump per release. Scope: Applies to the ontology; the mapping set and mapping vocabulary are versioned separately.</p> What does the 'latest' folder contain and how is it maintained? <p>The <code>ontologies/latest/</code> folder and the ontology's PID always resolves to the most recent available release. They provide stable access to the most recent files without needing to specify a version number. Each new release automatically updates the <code>latest/</code> folder and the file related to the ontology's PID to target the latest content.</p> How do I cite or refer to the Health-RI initiative and its artifacts? <p>You can use the following Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) to cite the initiative and its semantic artifacts:</p> <ul> <li>Initiative-wide identifier: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability</code></li> <li>Health-RI Ontology: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</code></li> <li>Health-RI SSOM Mapping Set: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/semantic-interoperability/mappings</code></li> <li>Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/mapping-vocabulary</code></li> </ul> <p>These PIDs are stable, dereferenceable, and aligned with FAIR principles. They are suitable for use in citations, publications, and metadata records.</p> What types of files are published with each ontology version? <p>Each ontology version includes the following artifacts:</p> <ul> <li><code>.vpp</code>: OntoUML conceptual model (Visual Paradigm project)</li> <li><code>.json</code>: OntoUML export compliant with the OntoUML Schema</li> <li><code>.ttl</code>: OWL ontology (based on gUFO) \u2014 only for syntactically valid models</li> <li><code>.md</code>: Human-readable documentation (Markdown)</li> <li><code>.html</code>: Human-readable specification (HTML)</li> <li><code>.png</code>: Diagram images (only in the <code>latest/</code> folder)</li> </ul> <p>These are published under both <code>ontologies/latest/</code> (most recent version) and <code>ontologies/versioned/</code> (versioned archive).</p> Where can I find the exported images of the ontology diagrams? <p>Exported PNG images of all OntoUML diagrams are available in the <code>ontologies/latest/images/</code> folder. These images are always generated from the latest <code>.vpp</code> file and are not maintained for previous versions.</p> Why is there sometimes no OWL (.ttl) file available for a version? <p>The <code>.ttl</code> file (gUFO-compliant OWL ontology) is only generated when the OntoUML model is syntactically valid. Incomplete or draft versions may not include a <code>.ttl</code> file until model consistency is ensured.</p> Can the latest version of the OWL (.ttl) file correspond to a different version than the latest version of the OntoUML (.json/.vpp) model? <p>Yes. The <code>.ttl</code> file is only published for releases where the OntoUML model is syntactically valid and the transformation pipeline completes successfully. If the most recent HRIO release does not include a <code>.ttl</code>, the <code>/ontology/ttl</code> PID will continue to resolve to the latest available <code>.ttl</code>, which may therefore correspond to an earlier HRIO version. When present, the OWL file includes a <code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> triple linking it to the OntoUML artifact version it was derived from.</p> How can I access a specific version of the Health-RI ontology? <p>Use the versioned PID format: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/vX.Y.Z/{format}</code></p> <p>Replace <code>X.Y.Z</code> with the version number (e.g., <code>v0.6.0</code>) and <code>{format}</code> with one of:</p> <ul> <li><code>ttl</code>: OWL ontology in Turtle format</li> <li><code>vpp</code>: OntoUML model in Visual Paradigm format</li> <li><code>json</code>: OntoUML model in JSON format</li> <li><code>specification</code>: Human-readable specification (HTML)</li> <li><code>documentation</code>: Human-readable documentation (Markdown)</li> </ul> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li><code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/ttl</code> \u2014 Ontology in Turtle for version 0.6.0</li> <li><code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v0.6.0/specification</code> \u2014 HTML specification for version 0.6.0</li> </ul> What's the difference between the latest and versioned ontology URIs? <ul> <li>The latest URI (<code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</code>) always points to the most recent stable release. Its content may change over time as new versions are published.</li> <li>A versioned URI (e.g., <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/v2.0.0</code>) points to a specific, immutable release. Its content will never change, ensuring long-term consistency.</li> </ul> <p>Use the versioned URI when immutability is essential \u2014 for example, in scientific publications, formal mappings, or regulatory documentation. This guarantees that your references always point to the same version of the ontology.</p> <p>Use the latest URI when you want to stay aligned with the most up-to-date ontology version and future improvements.</p> What is the publishing strategy for ontology releases? <p>What we publish (per release):</p> <ul> <li>A tagged GitHub Release with packaged artifacts (Technical Report PDF, exported figures) and detailed notes.</li> <li>An archived snapshot on Zenodo with a minted DOI (referenced from the Release notes).</li> <li>Artifacts exposed under w3id PIDs and repository folders:<ul> <li>Latest: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology</code> and <code>ontologies/latest/</code> (most recent release).</li> <li>Versioned: <code>https://w3id.org/health-ri/ontology/vX.Y.Z/...</code> and <code>ontologies/versioned/</code> (immutable per release).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Catalog and discoverability records: OntoUML/UFO Catalog entry/update; Technical Report on ResearchGate; announcements on LinkedIn.</li> </ul> <p>Where to get the files:</p> <ul> <li>GitHub Release page (exact packaged artifacts and notes).</li> <li>Zenodo record (DOI) for a preserved, citable snapshot.</li> <li>w3id PIDs and repository folders for \"latest\" and \"versioned\" access; images (<code>.png</code>) live under <code>ontologies/latest/</code>.</li> </ul> How are the OntoUML and gUFO ontologies and the produced semantic mappings maintained over time? <p>Ontologies and semantic mappings are maintained in version-controlled repositories and released through a structured publishing pipeline. Each release is assigned a permanent, citable URL, with both a Persistent Identifier (PI). Ontologies are published in multiple formats (e.g., RDF/Turtle, JSON) and validated prior to release. This process ensures transparency, long-term accessibility, and semantic stability across versions.</p> Who is responsible for maintaining the ontology and its associated mappings? <p>The Health-RI team is responsible for maintaining the core ontologies and mappings produced within the initiative. This work is carried out in close collaboration with external partners who contribute ideas, suggestions, and mappings. Contributions are reviewed and integrated through a structured, version-controlled process.</p> How will the new solutions be maintained and supported? <p>After a package reaches <code>pub</code>, we run the Publication Stage Operations Checklist while remaining in <code>pub</code>:</p> <ul> <li>Release and preservation: publish a GitHub Release (tag, notes) including the package report (PDF) and figures; trigger Zenodo and record the DOI.</li> <li>Catalog and discoverability: update the OntoUML/UFO Catalog; upload the report to ResearchGate; announce publication and follow-ups (e.g., DOI/catalog) on LinkedIn.</li> <li>Academic publication (optional): consider a peer-reviewed venue; when accepted, add the formal citation and publisher DOI to the docs and Release.</li> </ul> <p>Ongoing support and feedback: GitHub Issues remain open as a standing channel; substantive issues can lead to a stage reversion for corrective work. Scope: This operational checklist is specific to the ontology.</p> What happens right after a package is published (<code>pub</code>)? <p>While remaining in <code>pub</code>, we:</p> <ul> <li>Publish a GitHub Release (tag, notes, packaged artifacts) and mint a Zenodo DOI.</li> <li>Update the OntoUML/UFO Catalog and upload the Technical Report to ResearchGate.</li> <li>Post announcements and follow-ups (e.g., DOI/catalog) on LinkedIn.     Feedback continues via GitHub Issues; substantive issues may trigger a reversion to <code>int</code>.</li> </ul> How will the ontology be tested and accepted? <p>Acceptance is tied to passing the stage gate checklists:</p> <ul> <li><code>int \u2192 irv</code> gate (author self-check + modeling/diagram/metadata readiness).     Entry into <code>irv</code> happens only after all Internal Stage Gate items pass.</li> <li><code>irv \u2192 erv</code> gate (independent internal review).     Reviewers execute the Internal Review Stage Gate; evidence is recorded in the review issue.</li> <li><code>erv \u2192 pub</code> outcome (independent external review).     When the package passes external review, the modeler records <code>&lt;erv \u2192 pub&gt;</code>; then the Publication Stage Operations Checklist is executed while remaining in <code>pub</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Timelines: internal and external reviews are planned as sprint activities; the target is one sprint, optionally extended to two depending on scope and availability. Note: Substantive defects or scope changes at any stage can revert the package to <code>int</code> for rework; advancement then follows the same gates again.</p> Where can I find an overview of all persistent identifiers provided by the initiative? <p>The initiative maintains a consolidated table of all PIDs, covering the ontology, mapping set, and mapping vocabulary. This table describes the behavior of each PID (e.g., redirects, format-specific access) and provides examples.</p>"},{"location":"news/","title":"News &amp;

challenge.

If different parties are to share and reuse data, they need to be able to adopt and trust a common semantic solution.</p> <p>That trust depends on openness and community participation. A common semantic reference model can only succeed if the people who work with these concepts in practice can see how it is built, question its assumptions, and help improve it. Community review is therefore not an optional extra, but a core part of how we work.</p> <p>When we finish modeling a domain or subdomain, the corresponding part of the Health-RI Ontology (HRIO) moves into external review. At that point we issue a time-bound Call for Community Review for that domain model, inviting domain and modeling experts to assess its correctness and completeness with respect to both the modeling (e.g., correct use of modeling constructs and patterns) and the domain (e.g., appropriate concepts, relations, and constraints).</p> <p>These Calls for Community Review correspond to the external community review phase in the ontology validation lifecycle described in the Ontology validation and lifecycle page.

Interpret it as referring to data sources/schemas and their mappings.</p> <p>Across the health and life sciences, data producers and consumers often need to publish and consume data across institutions and systems. However, for this data exchange to be meaningful and analytically reliable, the data must be interpreted consistently and correctly by all parties involved.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> In practice, achieving this often relies on manual, case-by-case mappings across heterogeneous standards and local schemas, which is technically complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup></p> <p>Note</p> <p>In this page, \"schema\" is used broadly to include local database schemas as well as standard-level models (e.g., FHIR, OMOP, openEHR) and RDF/OWL artifacts used for exchange.</p> <p>Addressing this challenge requires moving beyond structural or syntactic alignment. What is needed is semantic interoperability\u2014a shared understanding of the meaning behind the data being exchanged.<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> Otherwise, systems may appear to agree because they use the same terms or data structures, while still committing to different conceptualizations. Such a situation can lead to false agreement.<sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup></p> <p>As illustrated in the figure above, each institution maintains its own data schema and data repository, often resulting in fragmented data silos.

External ontologies aligned through the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary (HRIV, <code>hriv</code>) can then be interpreted as being linked to the underlying conceptualization defined in HRIO OntoUML. This supports keeping meaning and representation consistent across models and ontologies.</p> <p>In this Figure:</p> <ul> <li>Real-world referents (globe and people, top-right): indicate the actual entities in the domain (e.g., human beings) that the conceptualization is about. These are the things to which all conceptualizations ultimately refer.</li> <li>Shared Conceptualization (top, cloud icon): represents the underlying domain meaning (e.g., Person) that is shared across different artifacts. This is the abstract conceptualization formalized in the HRIO OntoUML model, implemented computationally in HRIO gUFO/OWL, and explicitly anchored when an external ontology concept is mapped through the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary (HRIV).</li> <li>HRIO OntoUML class (<code>&lt;&lt;kind&gt;&gt; Person</code>, left): formalizes this conceptualization at the CIM layer, providing precise ontological grounding (in UFO) for what it means to be a Person. When we create a class <code>&lt;&lt;kind&gt;&gt; Person</code> in the HRIO OntoUML model, we are doing more than drawing a box labeled \"Person.\" We are encoding the meaning of Person in a structured way that the modeling language understands. In this sense, the HRIO OntoUML concept plays the role of a meaningful representation: it carries intentional meaning (e.g., the notion of a person as an entity with essential properties, understood via UFO's category of Kind) and it is also an explicit element in a model.</li> <li>HRIO gUFO/OWL implementation (<code>hrio:Person</code>, bottom): expresses that same conceptual meaning in computational terms at the PIM layer, making it machine-readable and interoperable. HRIO gUFO/OWL classes always inherit their semantics from the HRIO OntoUML concepts they implement.</li> <li>External ontology concept (<code>ont:Human</code>, right): denotes how a third-party ontology may define a similar concept. When mapped via the Health-RI Mapping Vocabulary (e.g., <code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>), such an external concept is explicitly linked to the HRIO gUFO/OWL implementation and should be understood as indirectly representing the HRIO OntoUML conceptualization (derived from the combination of implementation and mapping assumptions).</li> </ul> <p>Taken together, the diagram shows that (i) the HRIO OntoUML model provides the shared conceptual meaning, (ii) the HRIO gUFO/OWL implementation operationalizes this meaning computationally, and (iii) external mappings assert how third-party ontologies are intended to relate to this meaning.</p> <p>This supports that when a partner ontology concept is mapped to the Health-RI ontology using <code>hriv</code>, it is not only aligned with the HRIO gUFO/OWL class but is intended to embody the same conceptualization originally defined in the HRIO OntoUML model. In this way, interoperability extends beyond structural matching to the preservation of intended meaning.</p> <p>OntoUML and OWL are complementary in that they operate at different knowledge representation levels. OntoUML is a conceptual modeling language\u2014closer to human cognition and domain semantics\u2014whereas OWL is a computational ontology language\u2014suited for machine tractability and reasoning. Designing at the conceptual level first ensures the meaning is captured correctly before committing to OWL's computational restrictions.</p> <p>Theories of formal semantics tell us that an OWL class gets its meaning from two sources: the formal semantics of the logic (which treats Person as a set of individuals with certain properties) and the intended interpretation by the modeler (the conceptualization of Person). By explicitly maintaining the link (<code>hriv:hasExactMeaning</code>) between <code>ont:Human</code> and <code>hrio:Person</code> (which is anchored in the conceptualization), we ensure that the formal artifact is interpreted correctly. By grounding both the HRIO OntoUML and HRIO gUFO/OWL representations in that same conceptual meaning, we mitigate the risk of the OWL ontology drifting from the original intent. This establishes a traceability of semantics\u2014from the real-world domain, to the conceptual model, to the formal ontology\u2014which is a characteristic of rigorous ontology engineering.

[1] [3]</p> <p>Example: Student is a typical Role that a Person may play when enrolled in a school. A person isn't essentially or eternally a student \u2013 this Role is only instantiated while the person is involved in an enrollment relationship with an educational institution. When the person graduates or leaves school, they cease to be a Student (stop instantiating that Role) but remain the same person (their identity as a person is unchanged).

Phases partition the lifespan or state space of a Kind into exclusive periods or states, usually based on some property or stage (e.g., age, development state, status). A Phase is relationally independent (it does not require an external relator to be instantiated) but is temporary with respect to the instance's existence. All instances of a Phase share the identity supplied by their corresponding Kind, but only satisfy the Phase's classification during a certain timeframe or condition [1].</p> <p>Example: Child and Adult can be modeled as Phases of the Kind Person (assuming we partition a person's life by age). An individual person may be a Child in one period and then transition to the Adult phase later. The person's identity remains the same (as a Person) but they are classified under different Phases as their intrinsic attributes (in this case, age) change. Another example, in a butterfly's life cycle, Caterpillar and Butterfly are Phases of the Kind Insect (Lepidopteran) \u2013 the same insect individual goes through these phases, each phase being a temporary stage of that individual.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#category","title":"Category","text":"<p>Definition: A Category is a rigid non-sortal class (sometimes called a mixin class) that aggregates essential properties common to multiple distinct sortal types (Kinds or Subkinds). Categories do not supply an identity principle of their own (they are non-sortals) but are rigid, meaning if an individual instantiates the Category, it does so in all circumstances. A Category typically generalizes two or more disjoint sortal types that share certain fundamental features [6].</p> <p>Example: Physical Object can be modeled as a Category that generalizes different Kinds such as Person, Car, and Tree. All of those subtypes are physical objects sharing common essential properties (e.g., having mass and spatial extension), so those common properties are captured in the Category PhysicalObject. Any instance of Person, Car, or Tree will necessarily instantiate PhysicalObject as well, since it rigidly applies to all of them. Another example from ontology literature is RationalAgent as a Category that includes both Person and IntelligentSoftwareAgent \u2014 both persons and AI agents could be seen as rational actors, so the Category defines properties they must both have (like the ability to reason).</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#rolemixin","title":"RoleMixin","text":"<p>Definition: A RoleMixin is an anti-rigid, externally dependent non-sortal class that captures a role-like property shared by instances of different sorts (i.e. different identity-providing types).

Because it's anti-rigid, no instance is eternally in the RoleMixin type \u2013 an entity instantiates the RoleMixin only when it satisfies certain relational conditions \u2013 and because it's externally dependent, that instantiation depends on some relation to other entity(ies), similar to roles. In short, a RoleMixin is an abstract \"role pattern\" applicable across multiple types [4].</p> <p>Example: Customer can be modeled as a RoleMixin, since many different kinds of entities can act as a customer in a purchase context. For example, a Person and a Company (which are distinct Kinds with their own identity principles) might both play the role of \"Customer\". Instead of having separate PersonCustomer and CompanyCustomer roles, an abstract RoleMixin Customer can be used to capture the common features of \"being a customer\" that apply to both persons and organizations.

A PhaseMixin is essentially a generalization of Phase-like characteristics that can apply to instances of heterogeneous Kinds. In formal terms, PhaseMixins (together with RoleMixins) are exactly those types that are anti-rigid and non-sortal [4].</p> <p>Example: Consider an abstract condition like AdultOrganism that could cover adult stages of different species. We might model AdultOrganism as a PhaseMixin that applies to instances of Person, Elephant, Dog, or any other Kind representing an organism, whenever those individuals are in their adult phase. Each of those Kinds has its own identity principle (each is a Kind), and each defines its own Phase (like Person has phases Child/Adult, Dog has Puppy/AdultDog, etc.), but the PhaseMixin AdultOrganism captures the shared notion of \"adult stage\" across all those kinds. An individual entity (say, a particular dog) instantiates AdultOrganism during the time it's an adult, and a particular person instantiates AdultOrganism during their adult life stage. This modeling assures that AdultOrganism is not tied to one Kind's identity principle, and an instance ceases to instantiate the PhaseMixin when it's no longer in that phase (e.g., if it were possible to revert, or simply that it only instantiates after a certain age).</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#mixin","title":"Mixin","text":"<p>Definition: A Mixin is a non-sortal class (no single identity principle of its own) that aggregates properties which are essential to some of its instances but accidental to others \u2013 this means a Mixin is semi-rigid.

Mixins often represent a certain property or feature that can cut across different taxonomic hierarchies. They are used to factor out commonalities that are not uniformly essential to all instances [6].</p> <p>Example: An example of a Mixin is Seatable \u2013 imagine a property type representing \"being suitable for seating\". A variety of concrete objects can satisfy this: chairs and stools instantiate Seatable essentially (by their nature they are for sitting, so every chair or stool must be seatable), whereas a rock or a stack of books might instantiate Seatable only contingently (a rock can be used as a seat, but it's not essentially meant for sitting). In an OntoUML model, Seatable as a Mixin would have chairs and stools as essential instances (if something is a Chair Kind, it must also be Seatable), while also potentially classifying other things that happen to be used as seats (accidentally seatable).

For instance, an individual marriage Relator might connect two person instances as spouses; if either person ceases to exist (or the relational context is broken), that particular marriage instance cannot exist. Another example is a Purchase relator connecting a buyer and a seller (and perhaps an item); it is a single unit that depends on all parties \u2013 if the buyer or seller didn't exist, that purchase relationship instance couldn't exist. In a model, Marriage would be a relator class mediating Person-to-Person, EmploymentContract could be a relator connecting an Employee and a Company, etc.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#mode","title":"Mode","text":"<p>Definition: A Mode is an intrinsic moment (a dependent property or trope) that inheres in exactly one individual.

Unlike relators, modes do not connect multiple individuals; they characterize only their one bearer. In OntoUML, a class with stereotype \u00abmode\u00bb corresponds to a particular way some individual is, which depends on that individual [8].</p> <p>Example: Examples of modes include abilities, states, or conditions of individual things.

If we have a class Skill stereotyped as a Mode, an instance might be \"Mary's Spanish-language skill,\" which is a particular mode inhering in Mary. Other examples: a person's belief or intention (which exists in the mind of that person), an illness (a condition inhering in a patient), or a magnetic property of a specific metal object.

In UFO terms, a Quality mediates between an individual (the bearer of the quality) and a value (often in a structured value space, like a number or a position on a scale). Every quality instance is existentially dependent on a particular bearer (the entity that \"has\" the quality) and can be conceived as an individual quality trope (e.g., a specific weight, color, or temperature of something) [3].</p> <p>Example: Consider the quality of Weight for physical objects. If we model Weight as a Quality, an individual object (say, a specific parcel) might have an instance of Weight (a mode) that connects it to a value (e.g., 5 kilograms) in the weight dimension. Another example is Color as a Quality: an apple has a particular color trope (its specific shade of red) that links the apple to a position in the color space. In OntoUML, we might represent Color as a Quality class; an instance \"this apple's color\" is a quality dependent on that apple and is associated with a value (like an RGB value or a spot on the spectrum).

Any instance of a \u00abtype\u00bb is not a concrete individual but rather a category or kind at the object level. Because it is rigid, if something is an instance of a Type, it is necessarily so (it doesn't shift its classification in this meta-level sense) [7]. This construct allows modeling of metaclasses or \"types of types\" within the OntoUML model.</p> <p>Example: Consider modeling different models of cars: CarModel could be a class stereotyped as \u00abtype\u00bb. Its instances would be specific car models (which are themselves classes of cars in reality). For example, Tesla Model S or Fiat 500 would be instances of the CarModel Type \u2013 each of those instances represents a class of actual cars. Another example, species might be a class with stereotype \u00abtype\u00bb, whose instances are specific species (each species is a class of individual organisms).

For instance, if we have a Temperature DataType, its instances might be values like \"36.6\u00b0C\" \u2013 two occurrences of the value 36.6\u00b0C are not considered two distinct identifiable entities, but essentially the same value. In a model, one might have MassInKilograms as a DataType to represent mass measurements; an instance 5.0 (kg) is a value that could be attached to some Quality or attribute but is not an independent entity in the domain.

For instance, one might have an Accident class stereotyped \u00abevent\u00bb to represent accident occurrences.

In OntoUML, a material relation (stereotyped \u00abmaterial\u00bb) indicates that the relationship cannot hold unless a certain relator instance exists connecting the participants [1]. Material relations are typically contingent (not necessarily always true for the same pair of individuals over time) and are derivable: there is usually a corresponding Relator class and mediation associations that formally ground the material relation.</p> <p>Example: \"is married to\" between two Person instances is a Material relation \u2013 it holds due to the existence of a Marriage relator connecting those persons. If the marriage relator is dissolved (divorce), the material relation \"married to\" no longer holds. Similarly, \"works for\" (between a Person and a Company) is material, typically founded on an EmploymentContract or employment relator. The OntoUML model would include an explicit relator class Employment with mediations to Person and Company, and the material relation works for can be derived via that relator. In essence, material relations in the diagram show the surface-level connection (e.g., Person \u2013works for\u2192 Company) while a relator (e.g., an instance of Employment) and mediation links provide the ontological justification for why that relation holds.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#mediation","title":"Mediation","text":"<p>Definition: Mediation is a fundamental existential dependence relationship that connects a relator to the entities it depends on (its participants).

Mediation signifies that an instance of the relator cannot exist unless it is mediating (linked to) an instance of the other type, and typically the relator is dependent on at least two such entities (hence there will be at least two mediation relations for a relator). In OntoUML, each relator must mediate at least two distinct individuals. Mediation is a directed relation: it goes from the relator to the mediated type(s), indicating the relator's dependency on its participants [7].</p> <p>Example: In a marriage scenario, a class Marriage (stereotyped \u00abrelator\u00bb) will have two mediation relations: one mediating Marriage to Person (for the spouse role on one side) and another mediating Marriage to Person (for the spouse on the other side). Each Marriage instance must be connected via these mediations to two person instances \u2013 it cannot exist in isolation. Another example: an Enrollment relator between a Student and a School would be modeled with a mediation from Enrollment to Student and another from Enrollment to School. The presence of an Enrollment instance (say, a specific enrollment record) is contingent on a particular student and a particular school existing. Mediation explicitly captures that dependence in the model \u2013 e.g., \"Enrollment (John \u2190enrollment\u2192 University X)\", where the mediations connect the enrollment relator to John and to University X.</p>"},{"location":"ontouml-gufo/ontouml-stereotypes/#characterization","title":"Characterization","text":"<p>Definition: Characterization is a relationship that links an individual (the bearer) with an intrinsic dependent property (the feature that characterizes it).

The feature is an existentially dependent moment of the bearer \u2013 it cannot exist without the bearer, and it represents some intrinsic aspect of that bearer. The characterization relation signifies that every instance of the bearer type is associated with (or \"exemplifies\") an instance of the feature type in question.

[7]</p> <p>Example: If we model Weight as a Quality and Person as a Kind, a characterization relation might link Weight to Person (a person has a weight). An instance of Weight (say, John's weight of 70 kg) characterizes the individual John. John cannot have that particular weight instance without John existing, and that weight depends on John. As another example, consider a mode class Belief and an object class Agent; a characterization relation Agent has Belief means each belief instance exists in (characterizes) some agent. If Mary holds a particular belief (instance of Belief), that belief characterization link ties it to Mary as its bearer.

In effect, the derivation relationship specifies that if a certain relator instance is present connecting two entities, then a corresponding material relation instance holds between those entities (and vice-versa, the material relation's presence implies a relator). This construct helps maintain consistency: cardinality constraints on the material relation are determined by the combination of mediations and the relator's existence.</p> <p>Example: In a model with Marriage as a relator and a material relation \"is married to\" between Person and Person, we would use a \u00abderivation\u00bb to tie the is married to association to the Marriage class.

The derivation association often is shown as a dashed line from the relator to the material relation. Another example: a relator EmploymentContract might derive a material relation \"works for\" (Person \u2013works for\u2192 Company).

Both the whole and the part in a ComponentOf relation are typically functional complexes (Kinds or Subkinds that are complex objects). The relation is usually rigid for the part (the part must be part of some whole of the specified type while it exists) and often carries the inference that if the whole ceases to exist, the part's specific role or existence as that component ceases as well (depending on cardinalities and modality) [7].</p> <p>Example: A Engine is componentOf a Car.

It extends the Unified Modeling Language (UML) by incorporating the ontological distinctions provided by the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). Through UML's profiling mechanism, OntoUML defines a collection of class and association stereotypes that reflect the ontological distinctions present in UFO. It also establishes semantically motivated syntactical constraints to ensure that every syntactically correct model represents a sound UFO-based ontology.</p> <p>OntoUML introduced a methodological commitment to ontological analysis, helping modelers make conceptually sound modeling decisions. By aligning UML notation with foundational ontology, OntoUML became a practical and rigorous approach to ontology-driven conceptual modeling [1].</p> <p>Originally developed to make the use of foundational ontology in modeling more accessible and operational, OntoUML plays a central role in applying UFO in practice. The language was engineered to support the creation of high-quality domain models by explicitly encoding ontological distinctions in modeling constructs, enabling a principled approach to identifying and correcting conceptual modeling errors early in the development process [2].</p> <p>Over time, OntoUML evolved beyond a simple UML profile: it became a community-supported ecosystem with formal semantics and tool support.

Similarly, the ontology that would later be known as the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) was introduced in substance, though not yet by name.</p> <p>The formal naming and definition of UFO as a unified foundational ontology appeared in a set of contemporaneous publications by Guizzardi and Wagner [4][5][6]. These works extended the ideas from the thesis and applied them to domains such as agent concepts and business modeling, positioning UFO as a comprehensive foundation for conceptual modeling.</p> <p>OntoUML was conceived as a lightweight UML profile grounded in this ontological foundation, designed to bridge the gap between formal ontology and practical modeling. It provides semantically rich modeling constructs through stereotypes and well-defined constraints that reflect ontological distinctions\u2014such as types, roles, phases, and relators.

This capability is vital across various sectors, including healthcare, public administration, and the Internet of Things (IoT), facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#what-is-semantic-interoperability","title":"What is Semantic Interoperability?","text":"<p>Semantic interoperability refers to the ability of different computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Unlike syntactic interoperability, which focuses on the format of data exchange, semantic interoperability ensures that the meaning of the data is preserved and understood consistently across different systems. This is achieved by linking data elements to a common vocabulary or ontology, allowing machines to interpret and process information accurately without human intervention [1][2].</p> <p>A critical challenge that semantic interoperability aims to address is the \"false agreement\" problem, as defined by Nicola Guarino. This problem arises when different agents (e.g., systems or people) use the same term but mean different things, or when they use different terms but mean the same thing. Guarino explains that many current representation languages are ontologically neutral, allowing knowledge engineers to use identical formal structures to represent fundamentally distinct concepts. This neutrality often leads to false agreements\u2014apparent consensus at the syntactic or logical level that masks genuine semantic divergence.</p> <p>To prevent this, semantic interoperability frameworks must explicitly represent ontological commitments, ensuring that shared terms reflect shared understanding [3]. Building on this, Guizzardi adds that interoperability succeeds only when these commitments are not only stated, but also harmonized across systems [11]. Without this alignment, different agents may construct models that appear compatible but actually rely on divergent conceptualizations. As both Guarino and Guizzardi highlight, even when systems use the same vocabulary, they can still misunderstand each other if their ontologies reflect different views of the world. Semantic interoperability must therefore go beyond vocabulary alignment to include agreement on the underlying conceptual structure [4].</p> <p>As Guizzardi explains, every information system necessarily reflects a particular view of reality, whether explicitly or not. That is, it commits to a conceptualization\u2014a theory about what exists and how things are related. Even when developers are unaware of it, their systems make assumptions about the nature of the entities they represent. These assumptions must be clarified and aligned if systems are to interoperate semantically [11].</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#why-is-semantic-interoperability-important","title":"Why is Semantic Interoperability Important?","text":"<p>The importance of semantic interoperability lies in its capacity to enable accurate and meaningful data exchange, which is crucial for decision-making, efficiency, and innovation. In healthcare, for instance, it allows for the seamless sharing of patient information across different electronic health record systems, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. In public services, it supports transparency and collaboration between governmental bodies [5][6]. This need for meaningful data exchange is reflected in the FAIR principles, which highlight Interoperability as one of the four essential pillars of data stewardship [12].</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#semantic-interoperability-and-the-i-of-fair","title":"Semantic Interoperability and the \"I\" of FAIR","text":"<p>The FAIR guiding principles identify Interoperability as a central pillar for maximizing the value of information artifacts [12]. According to Guizzardi, the \"I\" in FAIR must be understood not just as a technical property, but as a commitment to meaningful, semantically grounded data integration that supports human interoperation mediated by machines [11].</p> <p>The FAIR principles I1\u2013I3 specify that:</p> <ol> <li>(meta)data should use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation;</li> <li>(meta)data should rely on vocabularies that themselves follow FAIR principles;</li> <li>(meta)data should include qualified references to other (meta)data.</li> </ol> <p>These requirements cannot be fulfilled by mere terminological resources alone. To ensure that systems interpret shared data consistently, vocabularies must be underpinned by ontologies\u2014explicit and formal representations of shared conceptualizations. Guizzardi emphasizes that vocabularies must be ontologically grounded in order to properly support semantic interoperability [11].</p> <p>To achieve this, two levels of support are needed:</p> <ul> <li>Ontologies (in the plural) serve as \"meaning contracts\" that clarify the domain-specific conceptualizations shared between systems;</li> <li>Ontology (as a discipline) provides the formal methods and theories required to build these ontologies correctly and to clarify their commitments.</li> </ul> <p>This ontological grounding is essential to ensure that relations between data elements reflect not only their syntactic alignment, but also their real-world semantics, including identity, dependence, and other ontological distinctions.</p> <p>Guizzardi argues that formal ontologies\u2014such as the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)\u2014play a key role in satisfying the interoperability requirements of FAIR. Ontology-driven representation languages like OntoUML allow modelers to specify their conceptualizations in a way that is formally constrained, semantically rich, and verifiable. This ontological precision is crucial to prevent the false agreement problem, in which systems appear interoperable at the surface level but interpret the same data differently beneath it.</p> <p>Ultimately, the \"I\" of FAIR demands more than connectivity and shared syntax.
