What is needed is semantic interoperability\u2014a shared understanding of the meaning behind the data being exchanged.</p> <p>As illustrated in the figure above, each node maintains its own data schema and data repository.

Its focus is on producing models that support human understanding, learning, communication, and informed decision-making. As such, OntoUML models are not directly suited for computational use in Semantic Web applications or automated reasoning tasks.</p> <p>To bridge this gap, the OntoUML model must be transformed into a computational representation.

If it is not, the schema cannot be programmatically linked to gUFO concepts. In these cases, the recommended approach is to create comprehensive external documentation that clearly registers the mappings between the schema and the gUFO ontology in a structured and traceable manner.</p> <p>If the schema is already implemented using Semantic Web technologies, the next step is to determine whether it is possible to extend or modify the schema:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the schema is writable and under the control of the team, the mappings should be directly embedded into the schema using standard RDF mechanisms (e.g., <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>, <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, or custom annotation properties) that link schema terms to the corresponding concepts in gUFO.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the schema is non-writable (e.g., maintained by an external authority, published as read-only, or subject to strict governance constraints), the mappings must be maintained externally. In such cases, the use of the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) is recommended. SSSOM provides a machine-readable, semantically robust format for documenting mappings between source terms and reference ontology concepts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, even if the schema is expressed in a Semantic Web format but lacks the structural flexibility to support such mappings natively (e.g., due to rigid serialization patterns or minimal annotation support), the mapping must still be registered in a formal and sound manner. This should be done in accordance with the capabilities and limitations of the target technology, ensuring both semantic precision and technical feasibility.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By tailoring the mapping strategy to the technical nature of each schema, we ensure that all semantic alignments\u2014whether embedded or external\u2014remain traceable, reusable, and aligned with the reference ontology.

Because it aims to represent concepts with a high degree of semantic precision, it naturally requires time, iteration, and careful validation.</p> <p>Rather than attempting to produce a complete and exhaustive reference model from the outset, the strategy adopted is one of incremental construction. The reference model will begin with a small set of well-defined core concepts.

It extends the Unified Modeling Language (UML) by incorporating the ontological distinctions provided by the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). Through UML\u2019s profiling mechanism, OntoUML defines a collection of class and association stereotypes that reflect the ontological distinctions present in UFO. It also establishes semantically motivated syntactical constraints to ensure that every syntactically correct model represents a sound UFO-based ontology.</p> <p>OntoUML introduced a methodological commitment to ontological analysis, helping modelers make conceptually sound modeling decisions. By aligning UML notation with foundational ontology, OntoUML became a practical and rigorous approach to ontology-driven conceptual modeling [1].</p> <p>Originally developed to make the use of foundational ontology in modeling more accessible and operational, OntoUML plays a central role in applying UFO in practice. The language was engineered to support the creation of high-quality domain models by explicitly encoding ontological distinctions in modeling constructs, enabling a principled approach to identifying and correcting conceptual modeling errors early in the development process [2].</p> <p>Over time, OntoUML evolved beyond a simple UML profile: it became a community-supported ecosystem with formal semantics and tool support.

Similarly, the ontology that would later be known as the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) was introduced in substance, though not yet by name.</p> <p>The formal naming and definition of UFO as a unified foundational ontology appeared in a set of contemporaneous publications by Guizzardi and Wagner [4][5][6]. These works extended the ideas from the thesis and applied them to domains such as agent concepts and business modeling, positioning UFO as a comprehensive foundation for conceptual modeling.</p> <p>OntoUML was conceived as a lightweight UML profile grounded in this ontological foundation, designed to bridge the gap between formal ontology and practical modeling. It provides semantically rich modeling constructs through stereotypes and well-defined constraints that reflect ontological distinctions\u2014such as types, roles, phases, and relators.

Unlike syntactic interoperability, which focuses on the format of data exchange, semantic interoperability ensures that the meaning of the data is preserved and understood consistently across different systems. This is achieved by linking data elements to a common vocabulary or ontology, allowing machines to interpret and process information accurately without human intervention [1][2].</p> <p>A critical challenge that semantic interoperability aims to address is the \"false agreement\" problem, as defined by Nicola Guarino. This problem arises when different agents (e.g., systems or people) use the same term but mean different things, or when they use different terms but mean the same thing. Guarino explains that many current representation languages are ontologically neutral, allowing knowledge engineers to use identical formal structures to represent fundamentally distinct concepts. This neutrality often leads to false agreements\u2014apparent consensus at the syntactic or logical level that masks genuine semantic divergence.</p> <p>To prevent this, semantic interoperability frameworks must explicitly represent ontological commitments, ensuring that shared terms reflect shared understanding [3]. Building on this, Guizzardi adds that interoperability succeeds only when these commitments are not only stated, but also harmonized across systems [11]. Without this alignment, different agents may construct models that appear compatible but actually rely on divergent conceptualizations. As both Guarino and Guizzardi highlight, even when systems use the same vocabulary, they can still misunderstand each other if their ontologies reflect different views of the world. Semantic interoperability must therefore go beyond vocabulary alignment to include agreement on the underlying conceptual structure [4].</p> <p>As Guizzardi explains, every information system necessarily reflects a particular view of reality, whether explicitly or not. That is, it commits to a conceptualization\u2014a theory about what exists and how things are related. Even when developers are unaware of it, their systems make assumptions about the nature of the entities they represent. These assumptions must be clarified and aligned if systems are to interoperate semantically [11].</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#why-is-semantic-interoperability-important","title":"Why is Semantic Interoperability Important?","text":"<p>The importance of semantic interoperability lies in its capacity to enable accurate and meaningful data exchange, which is crucial for decision-making, efficiency, and innovation. In healthcare, for instance, it allows for the seamless sharing of patient information across different electronic health record systems, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. In public services, it supports transparency and collaboration between governmental bodies [5][6]. This need for meaningful data exchange is reflected in the FAIR principles, which highlight Interoperability as one of the four essential pillars of data stewardship [12].</p>"},{"location":"semantic-interoperability/#semantic-interoperability-and-the-i-of-fair","title":"Semantic Interoperability and the \u201cI\u201d of FAIR","text":"<p>The FAIR guiding principles identify Interoperability as a central pillar for maximizing the value of information artifacts [12]. According to Guizzardi, the \u201cI\u201d in FAIR must be understood not just as a technical property, but as a commitment to meaningful, semantically grounded data integration that supports human interoperation mediated by machines [11].</p> <p>The FAIR principles I1\u2013I3 specify that: 1. (meta)data should use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation; 2. (meta)data should rely on vocabularies that themselves follow FAIR principles; 3. (meta)data should include qualified references to other (meta)data.</p> <p>These requirements cannot be fulfilled by mere terminological resources alone. To ensure that systems interpret shared data consistently, vocabularies must be underpinned by ontologies\u2014explicit and formal representations of shared conceptualizations. Guizzardi emphasizes that vocabularies must be ontologically grounded in order to properly support semantic interoperability [11].</p> <p>To achieve this, two levels of support are needed: - Ontologies (in the plural) serve as \u201cmeaning contracts\u201d that clarify the domain-specific conceptualizations shared between systems; - Ontology (as a discipline) provides the formal methods and theories required to build these ontologies correctly and to clarify their commitments.</p> <p>This ontological grounding is essential to ensure that relations between data elements reflect not only their syntactic alignment, but also their real-world semantics, including identity, dependence, and other ontological distinctions.</p> <p>Guizzardi argues that formal ontologies\u2014such as the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)\u2014play a key role in satisfying the interoperability requirements of FAIR. Ontology-driven representation languages like OntoUML allow modelers to specify their conceptualizations in a way that is formally constrained, semantically rich, and verifiable. This ontological precision is crucial to prevent the false agreement problem, in which systems appear interoperable at the surface level but interpret the same data differently beneath it.</p> <p>Ultimately, the \u201cI\u201d of FAIR demands more than connectivity and shared syntax.

In his formal treatment, a conceptualization is a set of intensional relations\u2014abstractions over possible worlds\u2014which logical models only approximate.
